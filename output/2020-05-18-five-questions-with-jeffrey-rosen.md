For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about Jeffrey Rosen's insights into constitutional challenges during the COVID-19 era.

> *How is the COVID-19 crisis affecting the National Constitution Center’s work?*
>
> As soon as the crisis began, we immediately embraced the challenge and opportunities of providing remote online educational opportunities, and we’ve found an extraordinarily responsive and large audience. We’re reaching learners of all ages across America we weren’t reaching before.
>
> Before the crisis, our mission was to distribute our educational material focused on the Interactive Constitution, which the John Templeton Foundation helped us build, both in person and remotely. We committed to bringing in tens of thousands of students from the Philadelphia area for a physical learning experience and also to connect tens of thousands of students online for remote learning. A week after the building closed in March we launched a series of live online classes about the Constitution for middle, high school, and college students. These are offered every Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday at noon and 1 pm. I’m teaching high school and college classes along with Kerry Sautner, our dynamic Chief Learning Officer, who conceived of the initiative.
