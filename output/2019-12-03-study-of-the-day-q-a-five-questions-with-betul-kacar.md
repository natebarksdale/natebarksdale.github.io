For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about Study of the Day | Q&A: Five Questions with Betül Kaçar.

> *Betül Kaçar is an assistant professor at the University of Arizona in the departments of Cell Biology and Astronomy. Her research investigates molecular mechanisms of evolution, the origins of life, and the distribution of life throughout the universe. Her research team uses a new approach that infers ancient DNA sequences using phylogenetics, engineers these reconstructed DNA inside microbial genomes, and reanimates them in order to study ancient enzymes in modern organisms.*

> *Kaçar’s work at the University of Arizona and previously at Harvard University has been supported by multiple grants from the John Templeton Foundation, including  the latest $357,843 grant “*[Molecular insights into historical constraints on evolution](https://www.templeton.org/pt/grant/molecular-insights-into-historical-constraints-on-evolution-2)*,” which concluded in May of 2019. This interview was conducted and edited by Nate Barksdale, lead writer for the John Templeton Foundation’s “Possibilities” newsletter.*
