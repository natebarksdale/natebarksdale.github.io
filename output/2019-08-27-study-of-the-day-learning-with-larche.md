In his speech accepting the [2015 Templeton Prize](http://templetonprize.org/pdfs/2015/20150518-Vanier-Templeton-Prize-ceremony-talk.pdf) for his work with L’Arche, Vanier said that “if we become a friend of somebody who has been humiliated, rejected, put down, seen as unimportant, something happens.
