  Wall splits heart of Berlin,

  Stone scars linger deep.

For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about the physical and ideological barriers that epitomized the Berlin Wall's history.

Because Berlin was in Germany’s eastern half, the city’s British, French and U.S.-administered zones were fully surrounded by the Soviet-run areas. The Soviets set up a communist-aligned state in East Germany and sealed the border to halt the migration of up to one-sixth of East Germany’s population to the West.
