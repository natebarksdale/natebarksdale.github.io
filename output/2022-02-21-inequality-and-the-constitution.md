  Rules bind the rulers,

For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about the intricate balance between governmental power and individual rights as examined through historical and economic lenses.

> ‚ÄúIf men were angels,‚Äù James Madison famously wrote in the [Federalist 51](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed51.asp)*,* ‚Äúno government would be necessary.‚Äù But governments were human institutions from top to bottom, Madison said, so ‚Äúthe great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in next place oblige it to control itself.‚Äù
