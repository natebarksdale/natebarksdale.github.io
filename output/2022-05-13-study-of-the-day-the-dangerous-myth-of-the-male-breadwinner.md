For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about Study of the Day | The Dangerous Myth of the Male Breadwinner.

> In 1968 anthropologists Richard Lee and Irvan Devore published [Man the Hunter](https://archive.org/details/ManTheHunter), an influential book that grew out of a symposium the authors had hosted about the ethnography of hunter-gatherers. Subtitled “The first intensive survey of a single, crucial stage of human development—man’s once universal hunting way of life,” *Man the Hunter* promoted the view that humans evolved in hunting-centric groups centered on men’s ability to acquire food for women and children. In it one contributor noted that hunting “gives men a distinctive and important subsistence role and was presumably the principal factor that created the nuclear family.”

> From the perspective of mid-twentieth-century middle-class North America, the ideal of a nuclear family with a male breadwinner and a female homemaker, made possible by postwar prosperity and an increased separation between the workplace and the home, found convenient support from a variety of apologists. Politicians and pastors argued that it represented an expression of ‘traditional family values’ tied up with [stylized visions of patriotism and Christian virtue](https://bookshop.org/books/jesus-and-john-wayne-how-white-evangelicals-corrupted-a-faith-and-fractured-a-nation-9781631499050/9781631495731). Even secular academics supported many of the same conclusions about ‘traditional’ human family roles.
