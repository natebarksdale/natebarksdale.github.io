  Earth cradles strange life,  
  Stars whisper of shared secrets—  
  Minerals hold keys.

For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about the intriguing intersection of chance, necessity, and life’s beginnings.

> Minerals may offer a key to understanding how common life is in the universe

> Our planet teems with life in even the most improbable places such as deep caves, undersea vents, or acidic hot springs. But is Earth the norm in the universe or the exception? Scientific and philosophical discourse on the prospects for life beyond Earth has long tended to gravitate towards two poles: on the one hand, viewing life on this planet as a sign of a cosmic imperative; or on the other, as a fluke unlikely to have been repeated anywhere else. For Robert Hazen, an astrobiologist and mineralogist based at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., neither pole offers a satisfying paradigm. Instead, Hazen and a group of colleagues are applying a new set of statistical methodologies to map the continuum of probabilities for the chemical reactions related to life’s origin — giving insights into how and where to look for evidence of life outside of Earth’s bounds.
