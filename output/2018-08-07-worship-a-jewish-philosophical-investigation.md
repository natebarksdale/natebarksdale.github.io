  Philosophic quest starts,  
  Worship's nature pondered deep,  
  Scholars gather thoughts.

For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about Jewish philosophy.

> When philosophers Aaron Segal and Sam Lebens set out to compile a comprehensive list of philosophical treatments of religious worship, they were surprised at just how little they found. “If you compile a bibliography on nearly any other concept in the philosophy of religion, it’ll have hundreds or thousands of entries,” Segal says. Their bibliography on the philosophy of worship turned up a mere 13 entries. “You just have a dearth of material, but it’s not for want of interesting questions. It’s just something that seems to be crying out for philosophical investigation.”
