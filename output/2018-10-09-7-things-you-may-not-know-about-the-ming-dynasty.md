For the History Channel, I wrote about uncovering lesser-known facets of the Ming Dynasty's profound legacy.

When his monastery was burned down a few years later during a conflict between Yuan dynasty soldiers and rebels from a Buddhist sect known as the “Red Turbans,” Zhu joined the rebels, quickly rising through the ranks and even marrying the daughter of one of his commanders.

Adjacent to the old Yuan dynasty capital of Dadu, which had been built by Kublai Khan beginning in 1264, the new Ming capital was surrounded by a wall 15 miles long and 40 feet high. In addition to an administrative hub with offices for government officials, the center of the complex contained the imperial palace, whose nearly 10,000 rooms could only be entered with the emperor’s permission. Known in modern English as the Forbidden City, the Chinese term for it, “Zijin Cheng,” means “Purple Forbidden City,” a colorful reference not to the city’s walls but to the night sky—particularly the purplish constellation with the North Start at its center, which the emperor hoped to emulate, with his new capital as the earthly version of this navigational star.
