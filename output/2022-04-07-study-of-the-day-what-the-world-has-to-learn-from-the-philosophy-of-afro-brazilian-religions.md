For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about Study of the Day | What the World Has to Learn from the Philosophy of Afro-Brazilian Religions.

> Seu Silva was enjoying an ordinary middle-class Brazilian life before the spirits intervened. One night he awoke with a start to find himself sitting on a grave in a cemetery miles from home. Another time he woke up shirtless, standing in the surf. He sought professional help before eventually being directed to a man who worked with spirits, who fell into a trance and diagnosed his condition: the *exu *Tranca Rua (the trickster spirit of an ancient defrocked Portuguese priest) was responsible for the nighttime journeys, and the spirits were calling Seu Silva to serve them as a medium. Seu Silva accepted the summons, and eventually became the founder and leader of the House of Father John, a center of the Umbanda religion in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro, where he serves the faithful by giving voice to helpful spirits who mediate between practitioners and deities.

> Social anthropologist Lindsay Hale recounts Seu Silva’s story, and his ministry, in his book [Hearing the Mermaid’s Song](https://bookshop.org/books/hearing-the-mermaid-s-song-the-umbanda-religion-in-rio-de-janeiro/9780826347336). Umbanda is a relatively new religion, founded in the early 20th century, that includes elements of 19th-century French Kardecist Spiritism, popular Catholicism, romanticized indigenous elements, and Candomblé—a family of religious traditions carried to Brazil from Africa by enslaved people.
