For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about the intriguing cosmic mysteries unraveling the universe's deepest secrets.

> *Paul Davies, **a theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and best-selling author is Regents’ Professor of Physics and director of the *[Beyond Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science](https://beyond.asu.edu)* at Arizona State University. His research has explored quantum gravity, black holes, early-universe cosmology, and astrobiology as it relates to the origin of life. In 1995 he became the third physicist to be awarded the Templeton Prize, both for his groundbreaking research and his work engaging philosophers, religious leaders and the public around questions of the universe’s origin and nature. Nate Barksdale, lead writer for the John Templeton Foundation’s “Possibilities” newsletter, recently spoke with Davies about his latest book,* [What’s Eating the Universe?: And Other Cosmic Questions](https://bookshop.org/books/what-s-eating-the-universe-and-other-cosmic-questions/9780226816296).

> What I tried to do in this book is to pick a few perennial big questions that people ask, like ‘What happened before the Big Bang?’, ‘Are we alone in the universe?’, ‘Is time travel possible?’, and ‘How will the universe end?’ Interspersed with those, I wanted to find curious and quirky ways of teaching the background science that you need in order to understand these questions. And so some of the questions — ‘Why is it dark at night?’, ‘What is the speed of space?’ — are really there to sort of set out the conceptual framework that you need to lead you to the other big unanswered questions.
