For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about Study of the Day | The Illumination Tour.

> When Gordon Gund completely lost his sight at age 30 from the genetic disorder retinitis pigmentosa, his wife Lulie told him she would understand if he chose to end it all. But, she added, if he chose to persevere in the face of the disability, he should be all in: “If you want to do it,” she recalls telling him, “let’s go for it.” Gordon Gund’s crisis, and the life that emerged out of it — a string of improbable and inspiring successes in business (arena-builder, NBA chairman, and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers), a pioneer in philanthropy and medical research (co-founder of the Foundation Fighting Blindness), and even a renowned sculptor — is the central focus of *The Illumination, *an 18-minute film directed by entrepreneur and conference founder Tom Scott.

> The film is also the centerpiece of four events this October celebrating the Gunds and their work. Conceived as a mini-national tour, *The Illumination* is part of the Nantucket Project’s “Carnival of Curiosity,” which also features live music, talks and special guests — not least Gordon and Lulie Gund themselves.
