  Hope cuts through deep gloom.

For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about a pivotal initiative aiming to uplift Philadelphia's minority entrepreneurs.

> Dozens of new minority-owned businesses in Philadelphia will launch with a targeted boost of strategy and capital over the next 18 months under the Entrepreneurs of Color project, a new initiative by the [United Way of Greater Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey](https://www.unitedforimpact.org) (UWGPSNJ) with $234,000 in funding from the John Templeton Foundation. The grant supports research into best practices that will inform the development of pilot programs. The pilot programs are meant to empower two cohorts of entrepreneurs, connecting them with capital, enlarging their professional networks, and providing education, tools and support as they establish and grow their businesses.

Poverty disproportionately affects the cityâ€™s communities of color: over half of the cityâ€™s black residents, and 38 percent of the cityâ€™s Hispanic residents currently live in poverty. And while 60 percent of Philadelphians are people of color, only 15 percent of the cityâ€™s small business are owned by people of color.
