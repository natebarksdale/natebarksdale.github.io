For the History Channel, I wrote about the intriguing origins and historical journey of ice cream.

> According to popular legend, ice cream was invented by the ancient Chinese, brought to Italy by [Marco Polo](https://www.history.com/topics/exploration/marco-polo), to France by [Catherine de Medici](https://www.history.com/topics/renaissance/medici-family), and thence to America by [Thomas Jefferson](https://www.history.com/news/thomas-jefferson-americas-pioneering-gourmand). The truth, however, about summer’s favorite chilled dairy treat is a bit more difficult to pin down.

> Iced drinks and desserts have been around since at least 4000 B.C., when nobles along the Euphrates River built icehouses to take the edge off the [Mesopotamian](https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-middle-east/mesopotamia) summer heat. Snow, likely used to cool wine, was sold in the streets of Athens in the fifth century B.C., while the Roman emperor [Nero](https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/nero) (A.D. 37–67) enjoyed iced refreshments laced with honey. Sources from the Tang dynasty in China describe a sweet drink made from iced, camphor-laced water buffalo milk.
