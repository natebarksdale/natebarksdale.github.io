  Spikes on horizons,  
  Data shapes our world anew,  
  Life in every hue.

Of course in this rendering, Asia -- where the real population-concentration action's happening -- is just a bunch of spikes on the horizon

> I recently came across these amazing data driven globes from [Yale’s G-Econ group](http://gecon.yale.edu/). The one above represents population density, but their tool allows for [all kinds of data to drive the topology](http://www.flickr.com/photos/arenamontanus/sets/72157594509798466/) from average rainfall to distance from coastlines.
