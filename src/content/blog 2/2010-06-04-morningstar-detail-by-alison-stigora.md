  Beauty in decay.

I love Alison Stigora's moving nearly-monochrome [drawings](http://web.archive.org/web/20110819213642/http://alisonstigora.com/section/57557_Drawings.html) and [sculptural installations](http://web.archive.org/web/20110129043142/http://alisonstigora.com:80/section/57537_Sculpture_Installation.html)‚Äîin particular how she creates her thickets, nests, and networks of bleached or darkened branches equally well in two and three dimensions. ArtPneuma has posted a [ten-minute interview](http://www.youtube.com/user/ArtPneuma#p/u/2/GtNyIC6hy-s) with Alison about her creative process and her thoughts about the aesthetics of natural destruction.
