Here's a great example of advertising that not only decorates but also provides comfort for the urban living room: an IKEA ad campaign set in the Paris Metro. Not clear how long it'll last or how well the sofas will hold up, but I do like the idea—granted, I've always been a sucker for [sofas in public places](http://web.archive.org/web/20101229134008/http://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/1140/).
