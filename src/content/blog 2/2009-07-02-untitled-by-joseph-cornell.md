  Names slip through the cracks,  
  Visions trapped in quiet frames,  
  Stars whisper in wood.

This morning's reading: an Octavio Paz poem, translated by Elizabeth Bishop. '[Objects & Apparitions, For Joseph Cornell](http://www.poesia-inter.net/op15021uk.htm).' Here's a pair of stanzas to whet the appetite:

'"One has to commit a painting," said Degas,  
"the way one commits a crime." But you constructed  
boxes where things hurry away from their names.

Slot machine of visions,  
condensation flask for conversations,  
hotel of crickets and constellations.' [![image](http://culture-making.com/media/cornell.1942.jpg)](http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/cornell/)
