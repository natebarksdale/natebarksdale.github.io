  Words dance in the night,  
  Whitman's spirit weaves through art,  
  Stars hum poetry.

This is a truly lovely 28 minutes, three poets of diverse backgrounds ([Eamon Grennan](http://web.archive.org/web/20090101050242/http://www.blueflowerarts.com:80/egrennan.html), [Major Jackson](http://www.majorjackson.com/), and [Patiann Rogers](http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/178)) coming together to talk about, read, and riff on the work of Walt Whitman, egged on by the ever-enthusiastic Michael Silverblatt. One of them mentions how Vincent van Gogh had been reading Leaves of Grass when he set about painting "[Starry Night](http://lilithmoerk.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/vangogh-starry_night_edit.jpg)," and soon enough we're hearing "[When I Heard the Learned Astronomer](http://books.google.com/books?id=9uIIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA214&dq=leaves+of+grass+I+heard+the+learned+astronomer&as_brr=1&ei=KlT3SdMuhuCRBMeP8aUE&client=firefox-a#PPA214,M1)" as it all falls dazzlingly into place
