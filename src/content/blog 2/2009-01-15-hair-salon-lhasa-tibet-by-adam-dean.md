I love the action and energy captured in this everyday interaction. From the photographer's caption: "A KTV (Karaoke) hostess has her hair styled in a modern hair dressers before starting her night shift at ‘Lhasa Nights’ karaoke bar, often a cover for prostitution, in the new entertainment district of Lhasa, China on 8 August 2006. The development is designed to cater for wealthy Han Chinese tourists, businessmen and government and military officials
