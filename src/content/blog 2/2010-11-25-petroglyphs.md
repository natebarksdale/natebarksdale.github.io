Alas, the site offers neither name nor date of these beautiful rock drawings. They have a similar look to those at [Newspaper Rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_Rock_State_Historic_Monument), near Moab, Utah. The style of many petroglyphs seems to be a sort of elemental human visual consciousness—some of the oldest surviving evidences of culture-making (though if these drawings are as exposed as the picture suggests, they're probably much more recent)
