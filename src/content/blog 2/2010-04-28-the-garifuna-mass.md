> At a Roman Catholic Church in the Morrisania section of the Bronx, Mass is said once a month in [Garifuna](http://web.archive.org/web/20220305075806/https://endangeredlanguagealliance.org/main/language-projects/garifuna), an Arawakan language that originated with descendants of African slaves shipwrecked near St. Vincent in the Caribbean and later exiled to Central America. Today, Garifuna is virtually as common in the Bronx and in Brooklyn as in Honduras and Belize
