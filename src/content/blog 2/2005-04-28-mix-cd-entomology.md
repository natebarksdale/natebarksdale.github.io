#### Wimbo Zuri Catalog No. 018.1A05-1

Created for an evolutionary biologist, each track on this mix is matched with a taxonomical order of insects. The fifteen songs on this disc cover half the orders. For the fifteen less-sung-about orders (including thrips, springtails, caddisflies, walkingsticks, etc.) I composed a single song that covered them all, which I put onto a bonus disc.
