For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about the notion that time itself might be an illusion.

> For Albert Einstein‚Äôs 70th birthday, his friend and walking companion Kurt G√∂del gave the physicist [an unusual gift](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/28/time-bandits-2): an exacting mathematical proof, rooted in Einstein‚Äôs own theory of relativity, that time could not exist (G√∂del‚Äôs wife had knitted Einstein a birthday sweater, but decided not to give it). G√∂del‚Äôs offering was a 20th-century variant of a metaphysical conclusion that certain philosophers have reached before: one of the most intuitively obvious aspects of our lived experience, time itself, might be a logical impossibility.

In Western philosophy, Immanuel Kant touched on the issue, and in 1908 J.M.E. McTaggart laid his cards on the table with [The Unreality of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreality_of_Time)_._ Since then, numerous philosophers, logicians and physicists (including Julien Barbour, who wrote [The End of Time](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-end-of-time-the-next-revolution-in-physics/18860198?ean=9780195145922) and Carlo Rovelli, who [has found NƒÅgƒÅrjuna‚Äôs philosophy helpful](https://www.templeton.org/news/what-does-a-1800-year-old-buddhist-classic-have-to-say-about-quantum-physics-and-the-nature-of-reality) for his own timeless grappling with quantum gravity).
