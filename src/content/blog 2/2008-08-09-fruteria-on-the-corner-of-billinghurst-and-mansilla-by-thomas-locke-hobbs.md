  Art in everyday.

Of this photo, my friend Thomas writes: "Talk about a special pineapple! The straw that outlines the shape of this _fruta elegida_ reminds me of a shimmering believer from some [El Greco painting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:2205grec.jpg)." Indeed. I love the amount of care that must go in to the daily arranging and rearranging of these displays -- click through to the original photo to see it in its full-sized glory
