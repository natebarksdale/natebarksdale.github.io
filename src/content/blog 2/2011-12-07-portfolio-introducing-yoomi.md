![](@assets/images/intro_yoomi.jpg) For months now I've been doing a number of design projects for [yoomi](http://www.yoomi.com), who've had their innovative self-warming baby bottle on the market in the UK for a couple of years and are currently rolling out into the US market. This is the front of a postcard I designed for potential retailers; I've also designed their convention booths, media kits, Facebook campaigns, you name it. Industrial design of the bottle and warmer itself were done by [IDEO](http://www.ideo.com/), who left quite a great toolkit for me to work with on the US rollout
