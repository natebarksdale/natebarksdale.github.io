  Lines of flight converge,  
  Atlanta's skies whisper tales,  
  Spirit in the air.

WIRED and artist Aaron Koblin created a Google map representing air traffic across the United States over a 24-hour period. It's fascinating how all the major flight hubs have such unique and geometric approach and departure patterns. In a weird visual convergence, the flights over Atlanta trace a symmetrical figure that reminded me of the standard stained-glass iconography for the Holy Spirit descending on Jesus after his baptism. Insert Bible Belt / Giant Face Found on Mars joke here. [![image](http://culture-making.com/media/atlantadove.jpg)](http://www.wired.com/special_multimedia/2009/ff_airspace_map_1703)
