  Sounds from the Nutmeg,

  Echoes of New Haven.

#### Catalog No. 036.1C07-1

One of the inaugural mixes of the [50 States!](https://www.natebarksdale.com/?tag=states) series of CDs, created in honor of my friends Doug and Dafna, who moved to New Haven in 2007. The mix features artists (Liz Phair, Spigga) and songs with a Connecticut connection, from Macy Gray's unintended salute to the Nutmeg State to a Cuban-Congolese play on the word Haven/Havana, to Bing Crosby singing about the virtues of Yale men.
