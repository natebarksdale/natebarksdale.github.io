For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about creating a comprehensive online theological resource.

> Over the coming few years, scholars, religious leaders and interested lay people will have a new source for overviews of theological topics — a long-form, open-access, peer-reviewed and regularly updated online compendium, the St. Andrews Encyclopædia of Theology. The project, based at Scotland’s oldest and most prestigious university and initially funded with a four-and-a-half-year, £3.3 million grant from the John Templeton Foundation, will offer rigorous yet accessible articles on key theological topics, beginning with Christianity, Judaism and Islam and eventually expanding to cover other major religious traditions including Hinduism and Buddhism. The Encyclopædia will be modeled on its philosophical analogue, the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu), which was launched in 1995 and today today features nearly 1,600 articles on philosophical topics as general as [metaphysics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphysics/) and as specific as the concept of personhood [in the Akan culture](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/akan-person/) of present-day Ghana.
