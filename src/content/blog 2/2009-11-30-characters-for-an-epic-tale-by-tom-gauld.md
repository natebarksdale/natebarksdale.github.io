I love how well you can project the content of a narrative—even one that doesn't exist—by simply seeing a list of the dramatis personæ. I also love that I just got to use the letter [æ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86) in a blog post. Actually, technically, it's a ligature—known sometimes by its traditional English name, ash.
