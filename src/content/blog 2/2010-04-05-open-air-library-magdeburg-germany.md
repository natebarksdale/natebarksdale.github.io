This self-styled "architectural bookmark" is the latest winner of the biennial [European Prize for Urban Public Space](http://www.publicspace.org/en/prize/2010). The designers [KARO](http://www.karo-architekten.de/) converted an unused industrial median into an open-access book repository and lending facility, at once compressing a typical library and turning it inside out to make a welcoming public space for reading, eating, school plays, and the like. I love how, in that orientation, the library‚Äîand the community space it creates‚Äîextends beyond the plaza and into the city itself. It reminds me of the [closing passage](http://web.archive.org/web/20160503111449/http://www.terindell.com:80/asylum/docs/asylum.html) of the Douglas Adams novel [So Long and Thanks for All the Fish](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22So%20Long%20and%20Thanks%20for%20All%20the%20Fish%22%20amazon.com).
