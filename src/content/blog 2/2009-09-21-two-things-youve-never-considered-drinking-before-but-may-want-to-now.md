Of course all these lists of "50 best things" are, even at their best, arbitrary and hyperbolic. But they're also fun—clearly scratching some itch in the collective mind of reader and writer. In the case of food/travel lists like this one, they really can be a treat

> **20\. Best place to buy: Olive oil  
>  Turkish embassy electrical supplies, London** The most unlikely olive oil vendor in the world? At his electrical supply shop in London's Clerkenwell, Mehmet Murat sells wonderful, intensely fruity oil from his family's olive groves in Cyprus and south-west Turkey. Now he imports more than a 1,000 litres per year. His lemon-flavoured oil is good enough to drink on its own.76 Compton Street, London EC1, 020 7251 4721,[www.planet mem.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130724153754/http://planet) **26\. Best place to eat: Filipino cuisine  
>  Lighthouse Restaurant, Cebu, Philippines**"The Lighthouse in Cebu in the Philippines is my favourite restaurant. We always eat bulalo (beef stew), banana heart salad, adobo (marinaded meat), baked oysters, pancit noodles, lechon de leche (suckling pig) and, to drink, green mango juice – my daughter is addicted to it! The staff are so friendly and welcoming. The chef has been there for more than 20 years, so the food is very consistent."Gaisano Country Mall, Banilad, Cebu city, Philippines, 0063 32 231 2478
