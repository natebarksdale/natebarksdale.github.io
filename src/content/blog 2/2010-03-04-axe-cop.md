  Child's voice spins a tale,  
  Heroes clash with bold colors,  
  Art springs from pure hearts.

[Axe Cop](http://axecop.com/index.php) is a web comic written by Malachai Nicolle (age 5) and illustrated by his older brother Ethan (age 29). I love the art that can result from listening to and taking seriously a creative voice that would usually have a far, far smaller audience. Here's a video of the duo [brainstorming Axe Cop #3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQiCwmolnYw&feature=player_embedded).
