  Sounds of laughter soar,  
  In India's warm embrace,  
  Bonds through every note.

Created for the 10th anniversary of a trip I took to India, with some of the people who are still my closest friends. The mix itself was a long string of lovely inside jokes (the title itself was one of them), of music we'd talked about during long conversations in Mumbai, Bangalore, and Nainital.
