Artist's description: "Dancers Among Us is a collection of NYC dance photographs featuring members of the Paul Taylor and Martha Graham Dance Companies. This is an ongoing project that began in the spring of 2009. There were no trampolines or other devices used for these images." The entire series is lots of fun, but I love the interplay of artistic exchange‚Äîgifts offered, gifts received‚Äîin this one.
