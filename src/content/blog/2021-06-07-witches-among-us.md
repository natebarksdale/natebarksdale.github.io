  Salem's fearful June,
  Gallows stand on pasture hill,
  Witch hunt takes a life.

I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2XQymM9cPcNZgfFJvLYpzo?si=-pwaP7AXSDS1JNqGm4Suiw) for The History Channel.

> June 10, 1692. Bridget Bishop is loaded into a two-wheeled cart and brought from her Salem jail cell to a pasture on a hill, where a rope is hanging from freshly-installed gallows. A crowd forms around her: law officers to read the death warrant, ministers to offer last rites, and onlookers, curious to see a witch in the flesh. Bishop’s execution raises doubts that could have stopped the Salem witch trials in their tracks. But instead, it became the first in a deluge of convictions, trials, and hangings that made the summer of 1692 go down in infamy. What happened that summer to cause a witch hunt? And what can we learn from the story of 19 supposed witches condemned to death?
