I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/01Zc3npxd6pnaVZ3Wyr3if?si=VKD4yfnzSbGiNYNt-jnvoA) for The History Channel.

> April 30, 1977. Nearly a month after entering San Francisco’s Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, a group of 150 demonstrators is going home. They’re singing, drinking champagne, and hugging the friends they’ve slept alongside for weeks on a cold office floor. Many of these activists are people with disabilities, and they’ve been sitting in to push the government to sign regulations that have sat untouched for years. What happened when a group of activists with disabilities staged the longest peaceful occupation of a federal building in US history? And how did this protest change accessibility in America?
