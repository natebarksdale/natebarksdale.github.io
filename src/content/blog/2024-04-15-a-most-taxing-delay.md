  Last-minute filers wait,  
  Self-defeat in each delay,  
  Costs rise, refunds late.

For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about the intriguing psychology behind why we postpone filing our taxes.

> Putting off doing your taxes until the last minute has been a cliche from the beginning — in 1954, on the very first time that U.S. federal and state income taxes came due on April 15, the _New York Times_ assigned reporters to cover the predicted chaos of last-minute filers. The [resulting lede](https://www.nytimes.com/1955/04/16/archives/income-tax-day-is-quiet-in-city-federal-and-state-collectors-get.html): “Federal and state income tax collectors were pleasantly surprised yesterday. The expected last-minute deadline rush of those filing 1954 returns failed to materialize at any of the offices.”
