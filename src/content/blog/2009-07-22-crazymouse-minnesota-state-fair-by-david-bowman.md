This glorious long-exposure photo is also the first reference to the Minnesota State Fair that I can recall that doesn't have to do with [terrible-for-you food innovations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-5Lr2IhB_o). Though come to think of it, that beautiful pink blur does look a lot like cotton candy. Or a mushroom cloud.
