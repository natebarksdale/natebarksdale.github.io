  Paths pave brighter tomorrows.

Cement floors and the horizons of the possible.

> Starting in 2000, a program in Mexico's Coahuila state called "[Piso Firme](http://web.archive.org/web/20170207060945/http://desarrollosocial.guanajuato.gob.mx:80/piso-firme.php)" (Firm Floor) offered up to $150 per home in mixed concrete, delivered directly to families who used it to cover their dirt floors. Scholar Paul Gertler [evaluated](http://web.archive.org/web/20160304174836/http://insciences.org/article.php?article_id=3181) the impact: Kids in houses that moved from all-dirt to all-concrete floors saw parasitic infestation rates drop 78 percent; the number of children who had diarrhea in any given month dropped by half; anemia fell more than four-fifths; and scores on cognitive tests went up by more than a third. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, mothers in newly cemented houses reported less depression and greater life satisfaction.) By 2005, Piso Firme had spread to other states, and 300,000 households--about 10 percent of dirt-floor houses in Mexico--had taken part in the program.

> It helps if the street outside the house gets paved, too--not so much for health reasons as for economic ones. Economists Marco Gonzalez-Navarro and Climent Quintana-Domeque [found](http://www.fedea.es/pub/seminarios/24-05-2011ClimentQuintana.pdf) in a 2010 study that paving the street in the town of Acayucan, Mexico, added more than 50 percent to land values and caused a 31 percent rise in rental values. It also considerably increased households' access to credit. As a result, households on paved streets were 40 percent more likely to have cars.
