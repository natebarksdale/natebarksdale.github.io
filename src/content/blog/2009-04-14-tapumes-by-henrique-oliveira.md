  Wood weaves into life,  
  Nature's form in the gallery,  
  Beauty from the streets.

Brazilian artist Henrique Oliveira creates sensuous organic "tridemensionals"—sculptural constructions made mostly from discarded wood collected on the streets of São Paulo. These images are from his current installation at the Rice University Art Gallery in Houston.
