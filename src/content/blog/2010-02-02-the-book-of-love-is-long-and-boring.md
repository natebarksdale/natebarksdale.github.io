  Gabriel's new sound,  
  Old Testament echoes flow,  
  Love in strings aglow.

A lovely string-soaked version of the Magnetic Fields song, to be included on Peter Gabriel's forthcoming covers album, [Scratch My Back](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Scratch%20My%20Back%22%20stereogum.com). The lyrics are pitch-perfect lovely and (maybe unintentionally, though I wouldn't put it past the songwriter) capture how I often feel when reading the Old Testament. Scratch My Back will also include Gabriel's version of my favorite pop song of all time, Paul Simon's [The Boy in the Bubble](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GykbnvufIZE). Simon and Gabriel are close enough in the pantheon that I can't tell whether the new version will be transcendent or redundant, but I can't wait to hear it
