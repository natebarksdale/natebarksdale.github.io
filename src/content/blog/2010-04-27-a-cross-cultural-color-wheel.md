[Click here](http://culture-making.com/media/955_colourscultures.jpg) to see the full color wheel. I'm not sure if there's a non-aesthetic reason to present this data in circular form, but though difficult to read this graphic definitely rewards scrutiny. I'm fascinated by the attributes that had only one associated color (Heat and Passion are only red; Strength and Evil are only black), by the ones that had many colors (Respect, Peace, Mourning), and by the ones that only had an assigned color in a single culture (pink Femininity and purple Cruelty in the West; yellow Deceit and orange Warmth in Japan; purple Gratitude for some Native Americans).
