A few years ago, some doctor friends of mine moved from Tennessee to the Boston neighborhood of Roxbury Crossing. This CD was created to commemorate the transition. The cover is from an [1841 public health pamphlet](https://www.google.com/search?q=%221841%20public%20health%20pamphlet%22%20memory.loc.gov)\)&linkText=0) I found in the Library of Congress website.
