I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GdLcfXJk9VOqpwFJ06dqR?si=3lPMUKyOQ92HF4D53fyzng) for The History Channel, including finding details of Bayard Rustin's trip to India, and the fine art of succinctly saying who should get credit for organizing the 1963 March on Washington.

> June 11, 1946. Bayard Rustin walks out of the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary after serving a sentence for conscientiously objecting to WWII. A pacifist organizer, his efforts reach the ears of Mahatma Gandhi, who invites him to India. And Rustin never looks back. Soon he’s mentoring a young Alabama preacher, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., as Rustin thrust into the middle of a Civil Rights Movement. But Rustin’s enemies want him gone, and the entire movement along with him. So how does this one man become responsible for the national reach and spread of active nonviolent resistance? And why, as the chief architect of the historic 1963 March on Washington, is his name not more known?
