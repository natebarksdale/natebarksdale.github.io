For the History Channel, I wrote about Henry VIII's complex life and legacy.

> In 1521, [Henry VIII](https://www.history.com/topics/european-history/henry-viii) published a book-length excoriation of the German Protestant reformer [Martin Luther](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/martin-luther-king-jr), referring to Luther as “a venomous serpent, a pernicious plague, infernal wolf, an infectious soul, a detestable trumpeter of pride, calumnies and schism.” In recognition of Henry’s forceful piety, Pope Leo X awarded him the title “Fidei defensor,” or Defender of the Faith.

In her final letter to the now-remarried Henry, the dying Catherine wrote, “‘Lastly, I make this vow, that mine eyes desire you above all things. Farewell.” Following the January 1536 news of Catherine’s death, Henry and his new queen, Anne Boleyn, appeared publicly in all-yellow attire.
