> Game theory, justice, equality, market failure, and public choice will be among the topics explored in a new series of videos and allied content for undergraduates in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) programs at universities worldwide. The curriculum is being produced as part of a two-year project, led by Jonathan Fortier of the Institute for Humane Studies at George Mason University and co-funded with a $217,400 grant from the John Templeton Foundation.

PPE curriculums are currently offered at 100 English-language universities worldwide, including 50 in the United States. Despite its reputation and spread, though, PPE instructors at an undergraduate level have noted a gap in good curricular resources on the topics covered.
