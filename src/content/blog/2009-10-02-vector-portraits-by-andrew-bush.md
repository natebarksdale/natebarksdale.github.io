  Wheels turn smoothly down,  
  Private worlds on the highway,  
  Life in motion sings.

I've seen Andrew Bush's freeway photographs here and there before (there's even a book of them, [Drive](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Drive%22%20amazon.com)), and every time I catch a glimpse I'm more intrigued. The composition is always the same: a car door, a driver, a bit of landscape, and a simultaneous velocity and stillness, the striking (and vaguely unsettling) intermixing of private and public spaces and moments—of life in the [million bubbles](http://web.archive.org/web/20090421215532/http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=822) of our highway culture.
