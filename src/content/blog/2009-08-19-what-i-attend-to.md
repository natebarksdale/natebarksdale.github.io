  Turning pages fast,  
  Mind engaged in silent space,  
  Lost in worlds of words.

This week I've been experimenting with a simple speed-reading technique, inspired by [this how-to](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/). It's definitely increased my page-count. As for comprehension and enjoyment, the jury's still out, but I'm hopeful. The novelty of the technique (basically starting and stopping each line a few words in, relying on your peripheral vision to pick up the rest) does make me attend to what I'm reading much more: there's less room for my mind to wander

> Here we have the paradox, since in giving up control we somehow gain it, by being brought in contact with ourselves. "My experience," William James once observed, "is what I agree to attend to" — a line Winifred Gallagher uses as the epigraph of "Rapt: Attention and the Focused Life" (Penguin Press: 244 pp., $25.95). In Gallagher's analysis, attention is a lens through which to consider not just identity but desire. Who do we want to be, she asks, and how do we go about that process of becoming in a world of endless options, distractions, possibilities?These are elementary questions, and for me, they cycle back to reading, to the focus it requires. When I was a kid, maybe 12 or 13, my grandmother used to get mad at me for attending family functions with a book. Back then, if I'd had the language for it, I might have argued that the world within the pages was more compelling than the world without; I was reading both to escape and to be engaged. All these years later, I find myself in a not-dissimilar position, in which reading has become an act of meditation, with all of meditation's attendant difficulty and grace. I sit down. I try to make a place for silence. It's harder than it used to be, but still, I read.](AlwaysWithHonor.com)
