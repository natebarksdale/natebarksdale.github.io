  Andersen’s delight,  
  Pictures dance for young readers,  
  Stories take their flight.

Ninteenth-century Tumblr-esque collages and papercuts from the Danish poet and storyteller:

"Hans Christian Andersen made several picture books for the children and grandchildren of his friends. We know of approx a dozen picture books, all made after 1850. This picture book, which the poet created together with his friend Adolph Drewsen, is made for the one year old Astrid Stampe (1852-1930), the great granddaughter of Hans Christian Andersen's fatherly benefactor Jonas Collin."
