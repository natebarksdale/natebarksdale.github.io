  Beauty side by side,  
  Lavish dreams with humble forms,  
  Stillness in the light.

I'm currently enthralled by Ebba Koch's coffee-table book [_The Complete Taj Mahal_](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22_The%20Complete%20Taj%20Mahal_%22%20amazon.com), full of photos and essays about the monument, a pinnacle of lavish beauty, planning and enforced symmetry. This back wall of windows, meanwhile, comes from the opposite end of the architectural spectrum: awkward, corner-cutting utilitarianism. But still lovely in its very modest way
