  In a house of friends,  
  Bridges built on humble hearts,  
  Change blooms from kindness.

For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about the profound lessons of community and inclusion within the L’Arche network.

> The L’Arche community began in 1967 when a French Canadian named Jean Vanier invited two intellectually disabled men to live with him as friends in a house in a small village north of Paris. Today, L’Arche — whose name alludes to its role as both a bridge and an ark of refuge for its members — encompasses 154 communities in 38 countries and more than 10,000 residential and non-residential participants.

> For Vanier — who [passed away in May](https://www.templeton.org/news/in-memoriam-jean-vanier-1928-2019) at the age of 90 — and for those who helped create and carry on the work of L’Arche, the values of humility and compassionate love have always been central. In his speech accepting the [2015 Templeton Prize](http://templetonprize.org/pdfs/2015/20150518-Vanier-Templeton-Prize-ceremony-talk.pdf) for his work with L’Arche, Vanier said that “if we become a friend of somebody who has been humiliated, rejected, put down, seen as unimportant, something happens. If you become a friend of somebody rejected, we are changed.”
