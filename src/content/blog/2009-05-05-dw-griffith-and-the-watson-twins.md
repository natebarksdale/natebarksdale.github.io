  Silent echoes clash,  
  Griffith's vision revives life,  
  Modern tunes take flight.

"Director D.W. Griffith's expensive, most ambitious silent film masterpiece Intolerance (1916) is one of the milestones and landmarks in cinematic history. Many reviewers and film historians consider it the greatest film of the silent era." I rented the DVD of _Intolerance_ a few weeks ago, only to discover that it wasn't the restored [Kino version](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Kino%20version%22%20amazon.com), but a blurry and at times illegible public domain cut with—insult to injury—a soundtrack that was merely a random playlist of classical music greatest hits! I was mad, though took it as an opportunity, muting the TV and putting iTunes on shuffle to see how the film worked with a contemporary soundtrack. Exceptionally well, I think: the best backers, for whatever reasons, were the Watson Twins. Here's a link to "[Watson Twins Radio](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Watson%20Twins%20Radio%22%20broadcaster.pandora.com)" on Pandora; open it in a separate browser tab, hit play in the box above, and prepare to be astonished
