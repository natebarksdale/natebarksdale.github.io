  Shadows of disease,  
  Posters wielding fear and hope,  
  Health's call to the brave.

The National Institutes of Health has an online exhibition of 20th century health posters from various countries, key-coded by different common visual motifs (hands, mouths, skulls, rodents, sinister blobs). Many of the posters present an odd mix of informativeness and fear-mongering; quite a few traffic in stereotypes of disease and contagion (and diseased/contagious people) that read uneasily in the present day. This anti-TB admonition is one of the cheerier examples. [![image](http://culture-making.com/media/endangersyou.jpg)](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/iconographyofcontagion/posters1.html)
