Frustrated with the way he saw poor people depicted in typical journalism and fundraising campaigns, a Canadian volunteer with Engineers Without Borders is photographing low-income rural Malawians he knows both as they'd typically be seen by the West, and as they prefer to see themselves. Evidently one difficulty in making the "poor" photos is getting his subjects to keep a straight face

> _Bauleni Banda, sustenance maize farmer, Chikandwe, Malawi_ The truth is that the development sector, just like any other business, needs revenue to survive. Too frequently, this quest for funding uses these kind of dehumanizing images to draw pity, charity, and eventually donations from a largely unsuspecting public. I found it outrageous that such an incomplete and often inaccurate story was being so widely perpetuated by the organizations on the ground ‚Äì the very ones with the ability and the responsibility to communicate the realities of rural Africa accurately.This is not to say that people do not struggle, far from it, but the photos I was seeing only told part of the story. I thought that these images were robbing people of their dignity, and I felt that the rest of the story should be told as well. Out of this came the idea for a photography project, which I am tentatively calling ‚ÄúPerspectives of Poverty‚Äù. I am taking two photos of the same person; one photo with the typical symbols of poverty (dejected look, ripped clothes, etc.), and another of this person looking their very finest, to show how an image can be carefully constructed to present the same person in very different ways. I want to bring to light some of the different assumptions we make about a person, especially when we see an image of ‚Äúpoverty‚Äù from rural Africa
