An interesting idea: applying fleet-management techniques to teenage drivers. I wonder, though, whether having the person who recieves the complaint be a parent rather than a manager effects the outcome (both in terms of deterrance and of punishment)? Somehow I doubt you'd get yelled at in quite the same way

> By placing our How‚Äôs My Driving sticker on your car, other drivers now have an easy way to provide feedback about your teen‚Äôs driving. Utilizing this information, concerned parents can work with their teen to correct poor driving skills and reinforce safe driving behavior.Every year nearly 10,000 teens die violently in automobile crashes. Young drivers account for 18% of all police reported automobile or truck crashes. This staggering fact should scare the parents of every teen driver.When a report is received, parents are contacted via mail or e-mail with information regarding your teen‚Äôs driving behavior. Utilize this information to teach your teen accident reduction and defensive driving techniques.Trucking companies utilizing ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs My Driving?‚Äù driver monitoring programs have reported a 20% decrease in accidents and ticketing. It‚Äôs our hope that Tell-My-Mom.com can increase safety in teen driving in a similar fashion
