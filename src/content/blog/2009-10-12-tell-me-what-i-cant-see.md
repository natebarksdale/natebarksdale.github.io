It's interesting but not surprising that radio can wind up beating television as a medium for the clear explanation of a sporting event. In Marshall McLuhan's [famous dichotomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan#.22Hot.22_and_.22cool.22_media), radio (along with movies and books) is a "hot" medium, becoming easily immersive by focusing on a single sense, whereas television is a "cool" one, providing multiple simultaneous streams of input that takes much more concentration and skill to take in and understand

He likes watching the games on television, he loves the New England Patriots‚Äìparticularly Tom Brady‚Äìbut he gets confused a great deal because the television announcers do a lousy job of explaining on what the play is, who‚Äôs in the game, and how the defense is set. We tried computers. I bought an old Madden game as a learning tool but that also assumes a great deal of knowledge about the game. Then this Sunday, we had to take an hour-long drive to meet my mother and do some shopping. We were driving back during the fourth quarter of the game between the Patriots and the Baltimore Ravens.

Or they‚Äôre flat out not as good. Take you pick
