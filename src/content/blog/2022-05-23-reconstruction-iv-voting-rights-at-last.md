I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/42Y3t8hN7rc8WvmB7bEvAr?si=d--k5uYHTyOduHKSs1XwBg) for The History Channel. I spent a surprising amount of time studying schematics of the U.S. Capitol to figure out how best to talk about the various Senate cloakrooms.

> May 26, 1965. One hundred years after the Civil War, Congress is debating a bill whose goal is to enforce the 15th amendment, which, in 1870, promised the right to vote regardless of race. But that’s not what happened. Now the Civil Rights movement is saying: It’s time to make real the promises of the Constitution for all Americans. The forces that undermined the First Reconstruction, and gutted the 15th Amendment, are resisting those demands. In the middle stands Lyndon B. Johnson, a Southern Senator with a record of opposing civil rights. Robert Caro, acclaimed journalist and Johnson biographer, tells us, what will change Johnson’s mind and turn him into a champion of the Voting Rights Act? And how will he manage the impossible task of getting it passed when so many Southern Senators are hellbent against it?
