  Voices rise and blend,  
  Shapes and notes unite us all,  
  Harmony in heart.

My local PBS arts show just replayed this great story about Portland Sacred Harp, a community group that cultivates the American tradition of shape-note singing. I love the inward-facing seating—the performers are simultaneously the audience!
