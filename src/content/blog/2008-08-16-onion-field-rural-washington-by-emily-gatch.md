description: A fascinating glimpse into a field of mature onions going to seed, showcasing their unique floral structures. "Onions that have gone to seed are so cool -- you may have seen ornamental alliums around town, with big bulbous balls, often purple. A field of onion flowers looks like an outerspace commodity."

  Onions in the field,  
  Stars of nature's design bloom,  
  Space-like beauty shines.

This photo arrived in an email from a good friend who's in plant pathology grad school. I had to email her to ask what it was. Turns out it's just a field of plain old ordinary onions that've been allowed to mature and go to seed. She wrote, "Onions that have gone to seed are so cool -- you may have seen ornamental alliums around town, with big bulbous balls, often purple.
