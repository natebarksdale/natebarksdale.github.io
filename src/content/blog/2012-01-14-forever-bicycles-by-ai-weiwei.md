  Bicycles in stacks,  
  Art that speaks of absence clear,  
  Freedom held at bay.

Chinese artist and activist [Ai Weiwei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_Weiwei) has an exhibition running through the end of this month at the Taipei Fine Art Museum—his first large-scale solo show, apparently, in the Chinese world. The show features a wide range of works in the border zone between sculpture and found object assembly. The knockout piece is undoubtedly this one, a layered vertical labyrinth of 1200 bicycles (sans seats and handlebars). The exhibition, incidentally, is titled\_ Absent because Ai remains under a travel ban in China and won't be able to attend.
