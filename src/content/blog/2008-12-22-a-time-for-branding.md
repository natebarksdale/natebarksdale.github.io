  Brands through the ages,  
  Clocks mark the signs of our lives,  
  Logo tapestry.

Designer Tanner Woodford, inspired by [this brand-timeline self-portrait](http://web.archive.org/web/20090726042218/http://dearjanesample.wordpress.com:80/2008/05/19/fun-with-brands/) made a time-based list of every brand and logo he encountered over 24 hours, and then arranged them all clock-wise (well, 24-hour-clock-wise). I'd love to see mockups for brands encountered by people in different places and times. I expect, for instance, that the clock of a 19th-century city-dweller might well be just about as full. A Renaissance nobleman's would be full of heraldry and religious iconography. But would a medieval peasant (assuming he lived far away from town or church) have anything for the face of his anachronistic clock?
