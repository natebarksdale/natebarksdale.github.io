#### Catalog No. 036.1B07-1

One of the inaugural mixes of the [**50 States!**](https://www.natebarksdale.com/?tag=states) series of CDs, created in honor of my friend Elizabeth, who moved to Atlanta in 2007 to begin work at the CDC. Selecting music for Georgia was an embarrassment of richesâ€”Ray Charles, REM, the B-52s, Outkast, and on and on.
