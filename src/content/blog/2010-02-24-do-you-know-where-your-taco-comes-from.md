  Tacos on the road,  
  Flavors traveled far and wide,  
  A journey of taste.

An attempt to map the journey taken by all the ingredients of a taco sold at a local taco truck in San Francisco. You can view a larger, barely legible version of this fascinating chart [here](http://rebargroup.org/doxa/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/TacoWorld_large_9-all-red2-1024x640.jpg). The orange lines on the map are thickest for edible shipments, thinner/dotted for aluminum and propane. The bar graph at the lower left lists the ingredients and distance travelled; the bar thickness indicates the type of shipment—thickest for trucking, thinner for train travel and ocean voyages. The list of ingredients, from least- to most-travelled is: Salt, Cheese, Tomatoes, Californian Propane, Cilantro, Sour Cream, Onions, Beef, Corn Oil, Lime, Tortillas, Pinto Beans, Chicken, Avocados, Rice, Saudi Arabian Propane, Adobo Seasoning, and Aluminum.
