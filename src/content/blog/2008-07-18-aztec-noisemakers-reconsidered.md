You gotta love the sort of patience required for endeavors like this

> Sounds still play an important role in Mexican society. A cow bell announces the arrival of the garbage truck outside Mexico City homes. A trilling, tuneless flute heralds the knife sharpener‚Äôs arrival. A whistle emitting cat meows says the lottery ticket seller is here
>
> But pre-Columbian instruments often end up in a warehouse, Velazquez said, ‚Äúand I‚Äôm talking about museums around the world doing this, not just here.‚Äù
>
> That‚Äôs changing, said Tomas Barrientos, director of the archaeology department at Del Valle University of Guatemala
>
> ‚ÄúTen years ago, nothing was known about this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut with the opening up of museum collections and people‚Äôs private collections, it‚Äôs an area of research that is growing in importance.‚Äù
>
> Velazquez meticulously researches each noisemaker before replicating it. He travels across Mexico to examine newly unearthed wind instruments, some dating back to 400 B.C. and shaped like animals or deities. He studies reliefs and scans 500-year-old Spanish chronicles
>
> But making replicas is only part of the work. Then he has to figure out how to play them. He‚Äôll blow into some holes and plug others, or press the instrument to his lips and flutter his tongue. Sometimes he puts the noisemaker inside his mouth and blows, fluctuating the air from his lungs
>
> He experimented with one frog-shaped whistle for a year before discovering its inner croak.
