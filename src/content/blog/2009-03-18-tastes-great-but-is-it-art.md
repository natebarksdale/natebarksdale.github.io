Fun and important questions about the aesthetics of food (and, for that matter, the aesthetics of aesthetics). At the end of the day it's all culture, though

> ![image](http://culture-making.com/media/433px-Arcimboldovertemnus_210.jpg)What issues might we be thinking about in trying to decide whether to classify cooking as one of the arts? Here are some. 1) Is the person who says of the Chateau Petrus they have just tasted that it is a work of art to be taken literally? 2) Is the experience we have of a Beethoven String Quartet sufficiently different from that we have when eating a great meal so that we should distinguish them as different kinds of experience? 3) Does it make sense to say of someone that they have been moved by a meal? 4) Is it significant for classifying something as an art form that a meal is consumed in the process of appreciation? 5) When I say of Grant Achatz that he is an artist in the kitchen how does this differ from saying he is a genius at the stove? 6) Why do we distinguish between the architect who designed Notre Dame and those who built it by designating the latter as craftsmen and the former as an artist? Is there a class bias exhibited by this distinction? 7) A piece of music can express sadness. A pate cannot. So?
