> **[Guatemala](/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala")** Generally called "shucos", are cooked in a carbon grill. They're served with the classic boiled sausage, guacamole, mustard, mayonnaise,boiled cabbage. If you want you can add ketchup, bacon, pepperoni, salami, Spanish chorizo, longaniza or meat. They cost around $0.50 in all Guatemalan cities. You may order the famous "mixto" who brings all the toppings already mentioned, but its price may rise to $2.00 or $3.00. **[Colombia](/wiki/Colombia "Colombia")** In [Bogot√°](/wiki/Bogot√° "Bogot√°") and practically all the country, the hot dog is eaten with an unusually great amount and variety of condiments and fixings. In a single hot dog, is normal to find mashed [potato chips](/wiki/Potato_chips "Potato chips"), cheese, strings of [ham](/wiki/Ham "Ham") or [bacon](/wiki/Bacon "Bacon"), ketchup, mayo, mustard, pineapple sauce, and chopped onion
