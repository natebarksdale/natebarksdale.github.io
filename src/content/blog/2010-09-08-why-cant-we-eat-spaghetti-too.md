  Tradition's fa√ßade,  
  Choice blooms in the market's heart,  
  Spaghetti is fine.

Earlier this summer, I posted an [earlier excerpt](http://www.culture-making.com/post/the_daily_grind) of culinary anthropologist Rachel Laudan's defense of the Bimbo-ization of Mexican bread. Here, she makes a wider historical, cultural, and sociological critique of certain ersatz-traditionalist beliefs of the foodie set

> So the sunlit past of the culinary Luddites never existed. So their ethos is based not on history but on a fairy tale. So what? Certainly no one would deny that an industrialized food supply has its own problems. Perhaps we should eat more fresh, natural, local, artisanal, slow food. Does it matter if the history is not quite right?It matters quite a bit, I believe. If we do not understand that most people had no choice but to devote their lives to growing and cooking food, we are incapable of comprehending that modern food allows us unparalleled choices not just of diet but of what to do with our lives. If we urge the Mexican to stay at her metate, the farmer to stay at his olive press, the housewife to stay at her stove, all so that we may eat handmade tortillas, traditionally pressed olive oil, and home-cooked meals, we are assuming the mantle of the aristocrats of old.If we fail to understand how scant and monotonous most traditional diets were, we can misunderstand the ‚Äúethnic foods‚Äù we encounter in cookbooks, at restaurants, or on our travels. We can represent the peoples of the Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, India, or Mexico as pawns at the mercy of multi¬≠national corporations bent on selling trashy modern products‚Äîfailing to appreciate that, like us, they enjoy a choice of goods in the market. A Mexican friend, suffering from one too many foreign visitors who chided her because she offered Italian food, complained, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we eat spaghetti, too?‚Äù
