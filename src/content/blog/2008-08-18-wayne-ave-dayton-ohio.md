description: An observation on the resilient charm of a Dayton neighborhood. "Much of the neighborhood around Wayne Street and Xenia Ave. seems down on its heels -- lots of boarded-up doors and windows -- but I liked both the remaining (and reasonably maintained) Victorian detail on this pair of houses, and the added patriotic bunting, which both fits in with the architecture and adds an ephemeral touch, a reminder that people are actively caring for this place."

  Victorian whispers,  
  Buntings drape the weary walls,  
  Hope in shadows blooms.

Just a fragment from a longer Sunday "drive" I took around Dayton this morning. Much of the neighborhood around Wayne Street and Xenia Ave. seems down on its heels -- lots of boarded-up doors and windows -- but I liked both the remaining (and reasonably maintained) Victorian detail on this pair of houses, and the added patriotic bunting, which both fits in with the architecture and adds an ephemeral touch, a reminder that people are actively caring for this place
