  Baltimore's shadow,  
  Black-eyed susans blooming bright,  
  Melodies of hope.

From the [**50 States!**](https://www.natebarksdale.com/?tag=states) series of CDs, commissioned to celebrate a good friend's sitting for the Maryland bar exam. Fun fact: there are a lot of great songs about Baltimore, but they tend to be kind of negative about the city. Design-wise, I worked to make the pattern more complex, adding an assortment of black-eyed susans (state flower) over a background inspired by the decor of the funeral parlor hideout in the later seasons of _The Wire_.
