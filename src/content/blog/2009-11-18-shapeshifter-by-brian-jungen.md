  Bones of plastic shape,  
  Art from the everyday finds,  
  Nature's echo speaks.

What's not to love about a whale skeleton crafted from the bones of our ubiquitous white plastic patio furniture? The artist's other work also remixes modern artifacts to reenvision traditional First Nations/Native American forms and patterns: golf-bag totem poles, baseball-mitt warriors. Jenkins' show Strange Comfort runs through next summer at the [National Museum of the American Indian](http://www.nmai.si.edu/) in Washington, D.C.
