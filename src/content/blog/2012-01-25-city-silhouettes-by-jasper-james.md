  Reflections collide,  
  Giants tread on tiny streets,  
  Life in balance sways.

Beijing-based photographer [Jasper James](http://www.jasperjames.co.uk/) has a wonderful series of portraits of people reflected against cityscapes. The images are all composed in camera—no compositing or Photoshopping beyond simple contrast adjustments. The result—giant humans superimposed on tiny buildings—inverts the usual urban experience, where the buildings dwarf each individual.
