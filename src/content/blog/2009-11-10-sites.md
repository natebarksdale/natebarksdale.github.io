  Cultures intertwine,  
  Sketches from lands far and wide,  
  Stories yet to tell.

I post interesting links and snippets of cultural commentary weekdays at [Culture-Making.com](http://www.culture-making.com)
I write a quarterly column about interesting cultural artifacts for [Comment Magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20250112200244/http://www.cardus.ca/comment)'s "Delights & Comforts" feature
I used to blog at [NBLINKS](http://nblinks.blogspot.com)
I once drew a series of [ballpoint-pen sketches](http://manwomanboygirl.blogspot.com) individuals from each and every single country in the world
