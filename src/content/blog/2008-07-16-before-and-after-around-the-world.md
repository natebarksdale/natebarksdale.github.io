The United Nations Environment Program has just launched this [Google map-enabled site](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Google%20map-enabled%20site%22%20na.unep.net) with before/after satellite images showing environmental change over the past few decades: cities grow, forests are converted to farmland, glaciers shrink. We're making something of the world, both for better and for worse.
