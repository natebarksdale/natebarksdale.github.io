For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about the New Pluralists.

> For much of the history of the United States, Americans have embodied the promises and paradoxes of the motto _E Pluribus Unum_, one out of many. Diversity is part of the American identity — according to the Pew Research center, more than three quarters of Americans believe the country has become more diverse in recent decades, and [more than 60% favor even more diversity](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/04/22/how-people-around-the-world-view-diversity-in-their-countries/). Yet the United States stands out among advanced economies for the level of perceived societal conflict. According to another Pew survey, [90% of Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/13/americans-see-stronger-societal-conflicts-than-people-in-other-advanced-economies/) said there are strong or very strong conflicts between Americans who support different political parties; 71% reported the same level of conflict between those of different ethinic or racial backgrounds, and 49% saw strong or very strong conflict between those who practice different religions.
