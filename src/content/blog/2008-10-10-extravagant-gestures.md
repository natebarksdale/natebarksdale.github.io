This just sings

> At the time of Lewis and Clark, setting the prairies on fire was a well-known signal that meant, ‚ÄúCome down to the water.‚Äù It was an extravagant gesture, but we can‚Äôt do less. If the landscape reveals one certainty, it is that the extravagant gesture is the very stuff of creation. After one extravagant gesture of creation in the first place, the universe has continued to deal exclusively in extravagances, flinging intricacies and colossi down aeons of emptiness, heaping profusions on profligacies with ever-fresh vigor. The whole show has been on fire from the word go. I come down to the water to cool my eyes. But everywhere I look I see fire; that which isn‚Äôt flint is tinder, and the whole world sparks and flames
