  Change fosters new growth.

For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about how developing good habits may be more crucial to self-control than sheer willpower.

> What is the difference between people who are productive, focused, healthy eaters, frequent exercisers, and thrifty spenders and, well, the rest of us?

But what if that narrative is incorrect, if people make the right choices not because they are masters of willpower but rather creatures of habit?
