For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about _Aeon_ magazine.

> Founded in 2012, [Aeon](https://aeon.co) is a digital magazine that provides a forum for writers, thinkers, and scientists to discuss ideas at the cutting edge of science, philosophy, society, and the arts through longform essays, idea pieces, and videos. With editorial offices in Melbourne, London, and New York, *Aeon *is structured as an international non-profit, relying on individual donations and grant funding to make its articles freely available to an aggregate audience of about 1.3 million web viewers and social media followers.
>
> A new grant from the John Templeton Foundation will provide support for _Aeon_’s writers and editors to produce three dozen essays and videos across four general themes: the dialogue between physics and philosophy around cosmology’s leading edge; the ways that new evolutionary insights — including epigenetics, population genetics, and complex systems theory — are enriching the story of life on earth; the cognitive science of consciousness and creativity; and the neuroscience and cognitive connections between spiritual practices, ethics, and mental health.
