  Whispers of winter,  
  Southern winds gently beckon,  
  Stillness in the sun.

A beautiful shot by a young LA-based photographer that for me triggers memories of many a Southern California winter. I love the odd stillness of the scene, despite the lean-into-it wind. [![photo](http://culture-making.com/media/4_amor43.jpg)](http://www.maryamor.com/ongoing/lifestyle/)
