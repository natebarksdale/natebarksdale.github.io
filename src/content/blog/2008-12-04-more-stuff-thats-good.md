  Pockets of bright hope,  
  Craftsmen rise from many hands,  
  Good mixed with the waste.

> In the past 20 or 30 years there have always been little pockets in the culture where people do interesting work. But now there are so many more places, so many more people who are willing to try anything. The result is that there’s a lot of crap, but there’s also more stuff that’s good at every level.
