Some lovely, [Walter Benjamin-infused](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction) thoughts on Cameron Moll's print/video project [Colosseo](http://colosseotype.com/), a hand-printed illustration (created, paradoxically, using graphic design software) of the Roman Colosseum constructed out of tiny delicate typographic elements

> And yet, here are Cameron Moll and Bryce Knudson managing to impart all kinds of aura and ritual to the reproduction. The reproductions are weirdly more authentic than the original which is just a file with dubious forward-compatibility.I enjoy this alchemy, made possible by the presence of easier reproduction techniques. It transmutes the time needed to make a letterpress work into painstaking labour when, at the moment of invention, it was labour-saving. Imagine the salespeople and inventors of these machines learning that their long term legacy would be assured by how difficult they are to use, compared to their displacing successors (yes, yes, I know there are special features of the resulting print that are unique to the process but the video is all about the process itself).What I‚Äôm deeply curious about is what comes next. At what point will the techniques have morphed and changed to that point that lovingly submitting PDFs to be printed ‚Äúby hand‚Äù on colour printer feels more authentic than whatever‚Äôs replaced it? I suppose we‚Äôre about due for dot-matrix nostalgia.I think we‚Äôre already seeing some glimpses of that sentiment in essays like this one: _I want to make things, not just glue things together._
