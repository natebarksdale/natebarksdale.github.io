Power without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental and anemic. Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice, and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against love

--Martin Luther King, Jr., "[Where Do We Go From Here?](http://books.google.com/books)
