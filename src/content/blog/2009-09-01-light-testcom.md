  On the roof they pose,  
  Light and color dance in air,  
  Behind, the scene glows.

From a photo blog dedicated to test shots taken by professional photographers, usually with their assistants standing in for the models, often with light meters or [color charts](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JLO31C/cmcom-20) in hand to make sure the colors stay true in post-processing. As Jason Kottke notes, the photos are often charmingly more candid than the end results we see in ads and magazine spreads. I find it fascinating because it reveals how much the photographer's (and assistant's) work on setup and lighting contributes to the glamor of the finished product: all the photo assistants look quite good, and often much more interesting than the models and celebrities who'll be in the final image.
