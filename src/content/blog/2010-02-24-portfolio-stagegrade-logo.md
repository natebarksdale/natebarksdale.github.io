description: I had the pleasure of designing the logo for the relaunch of StageGrade, an innovative publishing startup focused on theater reviews. The graphic element creatively incorporates StageGrade's unique bar graph representations of critical reviews, while the scalloped corners subtly nod to vintage theater tickets.

  Stage lights all aglow,  
  Bar graphs tell tales of the show,  
  Reviews pave the way.

![](@assets/images/stagegrade.jpg) I designed the logo for the relaunch of [StageGrade](http://www.stagegrade.com), an innovative publishing startup that offers reviews-of-reviews for Broadway and off-Broadway theater productions. The graphic element references StageGrade's unique bar graph representations of critical reviews; the scalloped corners of the bars are a subtle reference to the shapes of vintage theater tickets
