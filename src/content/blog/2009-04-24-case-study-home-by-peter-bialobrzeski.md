  In the shadows found,  
  Vernacular whispers hope,  
  Homes from found scraps rise.

From a series of photographs of houses in the Baseco compound, a squatter camp at the [mouth of the Pasig River](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=manila&sll=45.53015,-122.811567&sspn=0.010432,0.022037&ie=UTF8&ll=14.594797,120.958453&spn=0.007206,0.011019&t=h&z=17&iwloc=A) near Manila's port. The "Case Study" title is an allusion to the seminal midcentury California modern homes designed by Richard Neutra, Charles and Ray Eames, and others. In this case, the architects and builders remain anonymous, and the materials are largely whatever useful that could be found. I like this one because of its particular Philippine vernacular flair—traditional architecture showing through in a rough environment.
