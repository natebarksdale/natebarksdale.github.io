I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3iRbnvZb7jvJj4XFbsrQ7g?si=r10MJ0Q_QOOKuz9cBlgEOg) for The History Channel.

> Feb 13, 1920. For over thirty years, Black baseball players have been locked out of the major leagues. So on this day in Kansas City, Rube Foster, a former pitcher and now a team owner, is trying to make his own league just for Black players. He has gathered owners of other Black baseball teams, who currently play each other in one-off matchups or face independent teams in random games around the country. But Foster wants them to get organized, and soon, the Negro National League would be born.

And how did Black players, owners, and managers join together to create something that no baseball fan could ignore?
