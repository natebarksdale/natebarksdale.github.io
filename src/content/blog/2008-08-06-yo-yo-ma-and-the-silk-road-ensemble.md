As the world (or at least a good 4 billion of us) turn our thoughts towards Beijing this weekend, I recalled this wonderful in-studio performance from 2005, by a musical ensemble led (but by no means dominated -- he's merely a virtuoso among virtuosos) by cellist Yo-Yo Ma. They weave together many of the deep, rich musical cultures along the Silk Road, the ancient trade route linking Europe with the Far East: Persian, Roma, Mongolian, Chinese, etc. It's amazing watching this group of diverse musicians interact with, really listen and respond to, one another
