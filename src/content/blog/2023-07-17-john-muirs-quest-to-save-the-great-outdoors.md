  Sierra glory calls,
  His pen protects the wild peaks,
  Nature finds its voice.

I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qcnQv87MLCgRhBxc8BZsi?si=FezBA6bHQsmLdmBlR4u_rg) for The History Channel.

> July 19, 1869. Naturalist John Muir watches the sun rise over the Sierra Nevada mountains. He’ll write in his journal of the stirring birds, glowing treetops, and even rocks that “seem to thrill with life.” He’s so taken with this landscape that he’ll decide to stay in the Yosemite Valley and try to protect it with the only weapon he has: the pen. How did Muir collide with the political forces of his day and help bring about National Parks as we know them? And how did he change the way many Americans think about the natural world?
