  Swing in the city,  
  Laughter echoes through the streets,  
  Playfulness returned.

Here's a young UK designer's attempt to inject a bit of play back into a boring urban space -- in this case by hanging a swing from a bus shelter. It seems like a pretty temporary, for-video-only installation and probably having an approved, permanant swing in that space might raise all sorts of liability issues (not least: it's not clear how easy/tempting it would be to jump off the swing into traffic!) But it's fun to see how passersby react to the little remaking of their everyday urban world -- and interesting that only women seem willing to have a swing on it
