  From girlhood to queen,  
  Shapes change with the passing times,  
  Beauty's tale evolves.

Evolution of a cartoon heroine

> In addition to making Snow White fashionable, Grim also “began to absorb more and more of the actual live model” into his drawings, writes Johnson, who happened to be a 14-year-old girl named [Marge Belcher](http://web.archive.org/web/20071214002215/http://www.animationartist.com/columns/DJohnson/FourFaces/youngMarge01.jpg), who was 16 when they finished filming. Take a look at that face—it’s not exactly the childlike countenance Disney princesses have these days, is it?
>
> Look at Snow White on the [Disney Princess official website](http://disney.go.com/princess/html/main_iframe.html), Sure she’s been hipped up a bit to fit into modern times and, apparently, that included her waistline—it’s smaller than Barbie’s! (Go download Snow White’s wallpaper and then ask yourself, are the dwarfs even feeding her?)
