Honestly, my favorite songs on Sufjan Steven's 5-disc(!) album "[Songs for Christmas Singalong](http://web.archive.org/web/20121020182942/http://asthmatickitty.com/music.php?releaseID=63)" are the ones that aren't particularly Christmas-related but rather just great new settings of good old hymns. Still, the Christmas ones ain't bad either. Here are a couple found on the ol' Yuletube, which manage to be earnest, lovely, and surreal all at once
