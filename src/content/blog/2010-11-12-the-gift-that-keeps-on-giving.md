  Luxuries abound,

  Hope waits for the shoes.

More from the annals of unintended consequences ... in this case a long and thoughtful post by a Peace Corps volunteer, considering the "buy one for yourself give one to a poor person" model of consumer charity — and offering some simple changes that companies using that model might make

> In particular I remember this one guy Sori Sogoba; Sori is a 22-year-old who farms millet and peanuts and goes to Bamako every cold season to sell phone cards, and he has a wife and three kids who walk around town barefoot.

The Time That the White People Came and Gave Shoes to the Children is one of the few legends of Sanadougou lore that is recounted over the teapot on a fairly regular basis, and in accordance with their Messianic creed they had every reason to have faith that one day [The White People ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j3j9nYgP4w)shall return – with shoes, of course
