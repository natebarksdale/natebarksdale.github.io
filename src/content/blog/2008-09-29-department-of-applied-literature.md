A sort of high-end storefront secular church emerges in London

> London’s new [School of Life](http://theschooloflife.com), based in a Merchant Street storefront, offers [courses](http://web.archive.org/web/20090502074307/http://www.theschooloflife.com:80/courses.aspx) on “the five central themes of our lives—work, play, family, politics and love.” The school’s courses treat the classics (like Shakespeare’s sonnets or Tolstoy’s _Anna Karenina_) as works with practical, not just academic, value. It’s a refreshing approach. “Real” college literature and philosophy courses are often too distracted with their cerebral exercises (”deconstructing the narrative,” or whatever) to consider whether these works of genius might have actual applications in everyday life
