  Bottles stitched with care,  
  Soles that tread on sandy paths,  
  Art meets necessity.

I'm not even sure what continent this record of heartbreaking ingenuity reaches us from. It shows a variant on the more common repurposed footwear of the developing world, the car tire sandal. Presumably these are less durable and comfortable‚Äîthough perhaps on hot sand the bottles offer better insulation than rubber would.
