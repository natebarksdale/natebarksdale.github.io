  Tiny basket shines,  
  Shark's teeth woven, telling  
  Tales of Nauru's past.

This basket is beautiful, tiny (just over three inches tall), and presumably not for everyday use, what with the teeth and all. It comes from the tiny micronesian republic of [Nauru](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauru), known more recently as a tiny oasis of environmental devastation, tax-shelter hijinks, internet crime, [etc.](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/253/the-middle-of-nowhere)
