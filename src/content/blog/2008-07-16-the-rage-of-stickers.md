    Stickers on bumpers,  
    Territory marked with pride,  
    Rage ignites the drive.

People who customize their cars with stickers and other adornments are more prone to road rage than other people, according to researchers in Colorado…

People who had a larger number of personalized items on or in their car were 16% more likely to engage in road rage, the researchers report in the journal _Applied Social Psychology._

> > “The number of territory markers predicted road rage better than vehicle value, condition or any of the things that we normally associate with aggressive driving,” say Szlemko. What’s more, only the number of bumper stickers, and not their content, predicted road rage — so “Jesus saves” may be just as worrying to fellow drivers as “Don’t mess with Texas”

> > Szlemko admits that he is not entirely surprised by the results. “We have to remember that humans are animals too,” he says. “It’s unrealistic to believe that we should not be territorial.”
