  Winter's icy grip,  
  Monster reigns o'er silent waves,  
  Calm returns at last.

I've always had a soft spot for this poem, one of the set Blake wrote for the four seasons. Maybe it's the word adamantine's magnetic lure and [post-punk allusions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ant), but I really love the iron car, which I imagine as a used and battered 1980s Chevy Suburban. "To Winter," by William Blake, from [_Poetical Sketches_](http://books.google.com/books?id=uF8CAAAAQAAJ&dq=%22poetical+sketches%22+site:books.google.com&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=Z1RcZCJxsP&sig=l86Kt193Dj9GCuve3H81lcUdl0s&hl=en&ei=CecvS_3YII7isQPd7-HWAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false), 1783

> O Winter! bar thine adamantine doors:  
>  The North is thine; there hast thou built thy dark  
>  Deep-founded habitation. Shake not thy roofs,  
>  Nor bend thy pillars with thine iron car. He hears me not, but o'er the yawning deep  
>  Rides heavy; his storms are unchained, sheathed  
>  In ribbed steel; I dare not lift mine eyes;  
>  For he hath reared his sceptre o'er the world. Lo! now the direful monster, whose skin clings  
>  To his strong bones, strides o'er the groaning rocks:  
>  He withers all in silence, and in his hand  
>  Unclothes the earth, and freezes up frail life. He takes his seat upon the cliffs,—the mariner  
>  Cries in vain. Poor little wretch, that deal'st  
>  With storms!—till heaven smiles, and the monster  
>  Is driv'n yelling to his caves beneath Mount Hecla
