  Beauty in the waste.

I always like to work on leftovers, doing the leftover things. Things that were discarded, that everybody knew was no good, I always thought had a great potential to be funny ... I'm not saying that popular taste is bad and so that what's left over from the bad taste is good: I'm saying that what's left over is probably bad, but if you can take it and make it good or at least interesting, then you're not wasting as much as you would otherwise. ... I deviate from my philosophy of using leftovers in two areas: (1) my pet, and (2) my food
