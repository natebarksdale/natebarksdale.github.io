  Threading genes with care,  
  Colors dance in vibrant blocks,  
  Nature stitched in cloth.

From the artist's description: "This gene is involved in color vision. Part of its DNA sequence is encoded in the triangle blocks, which are then quilted in a double helix design. The base sequence and location of the gene are quilted into the border." Along with genome quilts, Beverly St. Clair also makes beautiful liturgical quilts and stoles for her congregational church in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts.
