> A little after sunset on Thursday, April 6, 1928, after 12 hours 50 minutes in the water, a lone swimmer scrambled onto a rocky shore at Punta Leona, Morocco and grabbed a handful of sand to take home to London as a souvenir. Cheered on by dozens who had followed her progress in boats, 27-year-old Mercedes Gleitze arrived at the northernmost point in Morocco in a manner that no known person had before: by swimming from Europe to Africa across the Strait of Gibraltar.
