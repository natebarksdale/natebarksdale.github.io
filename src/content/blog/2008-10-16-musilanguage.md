  Notes dance in the air,  
  Meaning found in sound alone,  
  Hearts whisper through chords.

News out of Iceland that doesn't deal with bank failures or the plummeting krona! OK, news might be a stretch, but we could all stand to hear some more Hopelandic these days

> According to evolutionary musicology, ‚ÄúMusilanguage‚Äù is a proto-linguistic form of communication somewhere in between, on the one hand, emotive grunting/cooing/moaning/what-have-you, and then on the other, semantically/ symbolically appropriate but sonically arbitrary sounds that convey meaning (i.e. words). As most things are when it comes down to it, this particular concept is about gettin‚Äô busy

> In ‚ÄúDescent of Man,‚Äù Darwin describes ‚Äútrue musical cadences‚Äù used by ‚Äúsome early progenitor of man‚Äù to woo the opposite sex (or to get totally whack with the same one). This ‚Äúmusilanguage‚Äù ‚Äî a term coined by neurologist Steven Brown ‚Äî would ostensibly evolve into language and music, respectively
> The Icelandic post-rock four-piece [Sigur R√≥s](http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/) is well-known for switching up the emotive and the referential. A made-up language _Vonlenska_ (‚ÄúHopelandic‚Äù in English), which emulates the cadences of Icelandic without actually meaning anything, peppers their songs up to the current album, _Me√∞ su√∞ √≠ eyrum vi√∞ spilum endalaust_ (‚ÄúWith a Buzz in Our Ears we Play Endlessly‚Äù). Now on [tour ](http://www.myspace.com/sigurros)in Europe, Japan, Canada and the US, the band‚Äôs bassist confessed in an interview with [Pitchfork](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Pitchfork%22%20pitchforkmedia.com)media, however, that all the hullaballoo about the nature of their lyrics and linguistic hijinks was, and is, rather hype. For example the title of a track on the last album, ‚ÄúGobbledigook‚Äù, was not so much a comment on how they express themselves, but rather a misspelling of the Icelandic ‚ÄúGobbldigob‚Äù, a word for the clippity-clop of horses‚Äô hooves
