Mitchell strikes me as perhaps the best example of a writer who sees the value not just in investigating what's behind the everyday, but in really pondering things‚Äîfiguring out, often over quite a long time, just what he makes of the people and places he's writing about. It's interesting to write elegiacally about Mitchell as the type of writer now rarely seen, considering that his own best pieces were also elegiac‚Äîwriting about things that were overlooked and, often as not, dwindling as the great mid-20th-century rambled on

> This summer marks the 100th birthday of the late Joseph Mitchell, who helped to redefine the art of journalism. In 1938, when Mitchell wrote his first profile for the _New Yorker_ , the notion of the reporter as stylist was still a novelty. By 1992, when the omnibus ‚Äù[Up in the Old Hotel](http://books.google.com/books?id=r6ZcAQAACAAJ&dq=Joseph+Mitchell&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result&pgis=1)‚Äù hit bestseller lists, it was ubiquitous. The recent republication of Mitchell‚Äôs finest collection, ‚Äù[The Bottom of the Harbor](http://books.google.com/books?id=m4MMAAAAYAAJ&dq=inauthor:Joseph+inauthor:Mitchell&pgis=1)‚Äù, brings back into focus innovations that have faded into familiarity or fallen into neglect. It couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time. Our current crop of reporter-stylists would do well to study the qualities that make this book remarkable

> Chief among these is patience. Contemporary magazine journalism often seems torn between ratifying conventional wisdom and railing against it. The twin temptations of sensationalism and contrarianism hover over online discourse, in particular. Not that technology is solely to blame; as a newspaperman in the 1930s, covering the Hauptmann murder trial and interviewing George Bernard Shaw for the _Herald Tribune_ and the _World-Telegram_ , respectively, Mitchell was near the centre of the media circuses of his day. Once the _New Yorker_ freed him from deadline pressure, however, Mitchell conserved his attention for (and lavished it on) subjects he felt it might dignify

> It turns out just about anything is fascinating if you look at it hard enough. What Mitchell chose to look at, in his increasingly lengthy ‚Äúprofiles‚Äù, were the remnants of Old New York that were disappearing beneath the city‚Äôs relentless growth: waterfront rooming-houses ("Old Mr Flood"), petty criminals ("King of the Gypsys"), Epicurean ritual ("All You Can Eat for Five Bucks") and, in ‚ÄúThe Bottom of the Harbor _‚Äú_ , the maritime life of a city most people forget is an archipelago.
