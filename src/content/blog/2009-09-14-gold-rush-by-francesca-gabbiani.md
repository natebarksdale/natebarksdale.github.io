  Fields of black and white,  
  Rococo whispers unfold,  
  Mirrors of the soul.

I'm really taken by the Canadian-born, Switzerland-raised, LA-based painter Francesca Gabbiani's rococo naturalism—many of her compositions serve as exquisite frames for empty fields of black or white, turning the paintings into a well or a mirror. It also reminds me of a certian sort of [circular panoramic photography](http://web.archive.org/web/20250119200929/http://www.samrohn.com/360-panoramic-photography/) that I'm seeing more of these days.
