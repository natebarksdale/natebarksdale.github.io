  Shadows in the dark,  
  Futures bleak without the light,  
  Hope's whisper unheard.

I wonder, how much does the same critique apply to Lazy Utopias and—more crucially for many religious folk—Lazy Apocalypses?

> Why is the dystopian future always literally dark? Why is it always raining or overcast? Why is the architecture always a mix of hyper-modernism, brutalism and squatter slum? Why is the politics always so transparently totalitarian, so fascist-plus-rebels? Why is it so retro and abstract?
>
> Why doesn't the dystopian vision ever include sunshine and children playing in its ruins? Why does it not include [the constant, untiring efforts of most people to do what they can with what they have to improve their situations](http://web.archive.org/web/20150908022031/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/008208.html)? Why are most people in the dystopian future always powerless to change anything? I could go on, but you get the point
>
> The biggest problem with dystopian fiction is not its pessimism. I do think there's a serious issue about who's interests are best served by making people fear the future, but I think the biggest problem with most dystopian fiction is its laziness and derivative quality. Lazy futures act like visionary static, crackling and dirtying the signal-to-noise ratio, making it harder not only for truly insightful futures to be found, but corrupting the ability of normal people to see why those visions are worth understanding
