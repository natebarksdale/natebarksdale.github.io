  Turquoise echoes bright,  
  Hidden gems in simple streets,  
  History in hues.

I love the little flourishes of local architecture that you discover on Google Street View—particularly, of course, in neighborhoods that've been around for a century or more. Things you first notice as totally odd—like this turquoise tile in a window-arch—come up again and again as you click your way down the street
