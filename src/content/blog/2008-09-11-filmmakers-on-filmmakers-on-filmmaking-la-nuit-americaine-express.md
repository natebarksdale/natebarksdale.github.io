One of my favorite movies of the past year is François Truffaut's _Day for Night (La Nuit Américaine)_ , which manages to be both an engaging light comedy and a wonderfully thrilling meta-meditation on the art (and inevitable compromises) of filmmaking. Truffaut plays a director, essentially himself, trying to keep a not-that-great movie production on the rails. All this reminded (pre-minded) me of some of the better moments of Wes Anderson movies—so I was thrilled to see Anderson himself offering homage (the nicest form of cultural copying) in, of all things, an American Express ad
