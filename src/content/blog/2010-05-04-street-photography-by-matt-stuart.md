  Cheeky frames of life,  
  Echoed gestures, laughter found,  
  Smiles in the hustle.

I love Matt Stewart's mannered, witty, sometimes downright cheeky street photos—the [black & white](http://web.archive.org/web/20150906073334/http://www.mattstuart.com/photographs/black-white) and [colour](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22colour%22%20mattstuart.com) sections of his site are worth full perusal. The photos are all about finding echoed gestures and surprising, double-take juxtapositions. Sometimes it can feel like a one-trick project, but the one trick always leaves me smiling.
