> ![image](http://culture-making.com/media/codex_210.jpg)The Codex Sinaiticus, the oldest extant copy of the Bible, has been digitized by the Codex Sinaiticus Project, and can now be viewed online [here](http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/project/). The manuscript contains the entire New Testament, and most of the Old Testament, all in Greek (the original language of the New Testament). The physical manuscript is divided unequally among four locations in Britain, Germany, Russia, and Egypt, so the online version marks the first time the Codex can be viewed in its entirety in 100 years, when the first part was taken from St. Catherine’s Monastery on Mount Sinai.The Rosetta Project Language Archive includes a [Greek Septuagint](http://www.archive.org/details/rosettaproject_grc_gen-1) translation of the first three chapters of Genesis[](http://www.archive.org/details/rosettaproject_grc_gen-1). This landmark Greek translation holds great historical significance, since it was the preferred translation of most Early Christian writers, including Paul, and is the text quoted throughout the New Testament.
