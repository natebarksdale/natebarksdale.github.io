Here's a popular Nigerian soap opera, produced with funding from one of my favorite NGOs, [Search for Common Ground](http://www.sfcg.org/): "Developed and written by a team of young Nigerians, The Station addresses issues that have been identified as the main impediments to the country's development, including tribal violence, domestic abuse, corruption, unemployment and HIV/AIDS. About The Station The backdrop of the show is Action News, a fictional Nigerian television news station. Through the eyes of the many people that work at the station‚Äîjournalists, anchors, cameramen, businesspeople‚Äîthe viewer experiences the problems and conflicts that exist among Nigeria's ethnically diverse population." Other country-specific radio and tv versions of The Station currently being produced throughout Africa and the Middle East
