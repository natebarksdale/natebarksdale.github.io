"New high-speed, ultrasound imaging of the human tongue potentially could change how linguists describe 'click languages' and help speech scientists understand the physics of speech production. Here, Ouma Hannie Koerant, a speaker of N|uu, a severely endangered click language spoken by fewer than 10 people in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa, prepares to have her mouth and tongue imaged as she pronounces N|uu words." Hats off to this brave woman and her scientific collaborators in a bittersweet act of last-gasp culture-keeping. Incidentally, the | in N|uu is a dental click (written as c in major South African languages like Zulu and Xhosa; the sound is "comparable to a sucking of teeth"). Those so inclined can also practice their alveolar clicks (q or !), "comperable to a bottle top 'pop'", and their laterals (x or ǁ), "comparable to a click one may do for a walking horse". There are also lip-smacking bilabial clicks (ʘ), and flat-tongued palatals (ǂ). I did my best to learn basic Xhosa click pronunciation a few years ago when I was reading Zakes Mda's fine novel [The Heart of Redness](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22The%20Heart%20of%20Redness%22%20amazon.com), to make sense of names like Qolorha, Ximiya, and Nongqawuse. Less esoterically, most of us are familiar with the name and San-language voice of N!xau, the late star of the film [The Gods Must Be Crazy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gods_Must_Be_Crazy) and its four (!) sequels.
