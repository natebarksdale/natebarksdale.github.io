For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about character and spiritual growth in seminary education.

> If you read the mission statements of a dozen North American seminaries, certain commonalities emerge. A composite statement would indicate that seminaries exist “to prepare and equip women and men for Christian ministry.” Much of that preparation can be quantified academically or vocationally — courses completed, papers produced, internships secured. What has traditionally been less easy to measure (and thus less-often measured) has been the development of individual _character_ over the course of their studies.
