My favorite social historian writes on the place of spices—and the importance
not just of their rarity but of their foreign-ness—in the culture of Medieval
Europe.

> The one thing that pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, ginger, saffron, and a
> whole series of other spices had in common was their non-European origin.
> They all came from the Far East. India and the Moluccas were the chief
> region for spices. But that’s only a prosaic description of their geographic
> origin. For the people of the Middle Ages, spices were emissaries from a
> fabled world. Pepper, they imagined, grew, rather like a bamboo forest, on a
> plain near Paradise. Ginger and cinnamon were hauled in by Egyptian
> fishermen casting nets into the floodwaters of the Nile, which in turn had
> carried them straight from Paradise. The aroma of spices was believed to be
> a breath wafted from Paradise over the human world.
