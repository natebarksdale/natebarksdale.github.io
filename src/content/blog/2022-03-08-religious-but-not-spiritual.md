  Devi prays to gods,

The camera pans down to a small altar with images of other deities (Lakshmi, Shiva, Hanuman) and ceremonial objects. A teenager’s voice intones: “Hey Gods, it’s Devi Vishwakumar, your favorite Hindu girl in the San Fernando Valley. What’s a-poppin?”

> So starts the pilot episode of the Netflix comedy series “[Never Have I Ever](https://www.netflix.com/title/80179190),” created by Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher. The series draws from Kaling’s experiences growing up as the child of South Asian immigrants, and has been viewed as a breakthrough moment for portraying a more multifaceted account of the lives of South Asian American girls and women, including their religious practices. Kaling [told the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/arts/television/mindy-kaling-never-have-I-ever-netflix.html) the “Hey Gods” opening line came verbatim from some of her own prayers as a teenager. Other plot points in the show’s opening episodes include proper care for a chemistry book that has been blessed by a Hindu priest, and the desires each main character brings to the altar at the Ganesh Puja festival held by Devi’s community at a local high school.
