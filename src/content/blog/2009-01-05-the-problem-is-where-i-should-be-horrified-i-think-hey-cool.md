  Timber falls softly,  
  Machines tread with care and hope,  
  Forest breathes anew.

Cool for sustainable timber harvest, one hopes. Do follow the link for a [much larger version](http://www.ibelieveinadv.com/commons/oroverde-rainforest-foundation.jpg)—sadly, I have to conclude that the "range" maps for each type of machine are probably rather fabricated. The amazing six-legged Timberjack Harvester ([awesome promo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2V8GFqk_Y)) is only a working prototype; John Deere bought the company that designed it, but doesn't seem to offer them yet
