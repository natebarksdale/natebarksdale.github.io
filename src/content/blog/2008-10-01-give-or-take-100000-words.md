  Words stretch and diverge,  
  Intent lost in the echoes,  
  Stories shaped by hands.

Translation is always a more complex business than you'd initially think

> **Literature |** A new [English translation](http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780679643333) of Hugo’s sprawling and digressive “Les Misérables” is _100,000 words longer_ than its best-known predecessor. So it draws attention to the translator’s mission of sticking to an author’s intent. Or in some cases not? In America, the 1863 “Confederate” edition, unlike a rival “Yankee” edition, “struck out all references to slavery.” [[TLS](http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article4816401.ece)]
