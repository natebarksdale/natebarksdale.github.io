  Laws of ancient days,  
  Teaching us to live in grace,  
  Chosen, we embrace.

My own recent experience with Leviticus -- just reading through it, a page a day -- was less interactive but still astonishingly profound, partly for the utter surprising strangeness of certain passages. These days I'm getting similar thrills out of the more boring sections of 2 Kings, parts of which seem scripted for an Akira Kurusawa samurai epic

> If the rest of the congregation were to learn from our experiment, they had to be able to observe it beyond just hearing about it in sermons. Therefore, each participant opened a Facebook account and joined a Facebook group we named ‚ÄúLiving Leviticus.‚Äù Participants posted journal entries, photos, comments, and videos. Daily online activity reminded us that we each were part of a (virtual) community of obedience. Because Facebook is a social networking site, a couple hundred people also joined the group and many more from all over the world logged in to read and comment. A cluster of Messianic Jews even got ahold of our page and began offering their own advice on how to keep Torah

> Among the many lessons from the month, rising to the top was the realization of how much we take God‚Äôs grace for granted. Because holiness can be difficult, we default to simply admitting we‚Äôre miserable sinners, get our grace, and then get on with living our lives the way we were going to live them anyway. As one participant put it, ‚ÄúI never before realized just how good I am at detaching God from my day-to-day life.‚Äù But if reading Leviticus only succeeds in making you feel bad for being a lousy Christian, you‚Äôve missed its point. Leviticus isn‚Äôt in the Bible merely to show you your need for grace. It‚Äôs in the Bible to show you what grace is for. The ancient Israelites were already chosen people before God gave them the Law. The Law‚Äôs purpose was never to save anybody. Rather, its purpose was to show saved people how to live a saved life.
