For the past several years, my anthropologist friend has been doing research on the geopolitics of the triple-border between Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. It's a fascinating topic, and I've enjoyed getting updates and reading suggestions from a growing expert. This mix was made as a celebration of the Triple Frontera and its multiple identities, about peoples and languages and rivers and borders.
