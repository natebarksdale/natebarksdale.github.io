The article also includes the important qualification that cultural offerings still have to be good‚Äîindeed, the goodness of _Kim_ or _Anna Karenina_ is a necessary but not sufficient condition

> One of the commonest complaints by cultural doomsayers is that nobody reads good books any more. Yet in the past two years, the [Oprah Book Club](http://web.archive.org/web/20100105143046/http://www.oprah.com/entity/oprahsbookclub) in America recommended Tolstoy‚Äôs [‚ÄúAnna Karenina‚Äù](http://web.archive.org/web/20241218185804/https://www.amazon.com/Anna-Karenina-Oprahs-Book-Club/dp/0143035002) and three novels by [William Faulkner](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22William%20Faulkner%22%20moreintelligentlife.com)‚Äîgood by any standard, and they all made the bestseller lists. This year, Waterstone‚Äôs, which owns over 300 bookshops in Britain, asked two celebrated novelists, Sebastian Faulks and [Philip Pullman](http://web.archive.org/web/20150929081822/http://moreintelligentlife.com/story/an-interview-with-philip-pullman), each to choose 40 titles and write a few words of recommendation. The chain then piled copies of the books on tables next to the entrances of its main shops and waited to see what would happen. Faulks and Pullman hardly dumbed down their choices: they included Fernando Pessoa‚Äôs [‚ÄúBook of Disquiet‚Äù](http://web.archive.org/web/20241218124357/https://www.amazon.com/Book-Disquiet-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141183047), Rudyard Kipling‚Äôs [‚ÄúKim‚Äù](http://web.archive.org/web/20110427175724/http://www.amazon.com:80/Kim-Bantam-Classics-Rudyard-Kipling/dp/0553213326), and Raymond Queneau‚Äôs [‚ÄúExercises in Style‚Äù](http://web.archive.org/web/20240519093334/https://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Style-Raymond-Queneau/dp/0811207897). The sales increases for these books over the same period the year before were, respectively, 1,350%, 1,420% and 1,800%‚Äîclear evidence of latent demand. If you offer it, they will come.
