Some lovely seasonal bedroom big-band from Pomplamoose, the guy-and-girl duo Andy's [written about before](http://www.culture-making.com/post/beyond_beyonce). The video's show-it-all style is as winsome as usual. As a bonus, once the song ends Jack and Nataly break out of their deadpan to offer an off-the-cuff promotion of the [World Vision gift catalog](http://web.archive.org/web/20130918132943/http://donate.worldvision.org/OA_HTML/xxwv2ibeCCtpSctDspRte.jsp?section=10375) (which Andy's also [posted about](http://www.culture-making.com/post/goat_75)). If you make a gift and email Pomplamoose your receipt, you get an mp3 of this song plus a bonus track
