  Grandfather's strong hands,  
  Turf rises from ancient bog,  
  Roots of place and past.

I'd memorized Seamus Heaney's wonderful poem "[Digging](http://web.archive.org/web/20180802084416/http://www.bbc.co.uk:80/schools/gcsebitesize/english_literature/poetheaney/diggingrev_print.shtml)" (from _Death of a Naturalist_ , 1966) some time before I happened upon footage of what turf-cutting actually looked like. It struck me as simultaneously more noble and artful and more humble than what I'd imagined from the poet's words alone. Here's a section from that poem:My grandfather could cut more turf in a day  
Than any other man on Toner’s bog.  
Once I carried him milk in a bottle  
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up  
To drink it, then fell to right away  
Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods  
Over his shoulder, digging down and down  
For the good turf. Digging
