  Whales in wood hues,  
  Songs echo through endless space,  
  Nature's grace and plight.

I simply liked these whales in shades of wood (provenance unknown—but isn't that the way with whales?), combining both a handmade/natural and graphic-design aesthetic. And these lines I read yesterday in the _Literary Review_ , from a piece on Philip Hoare's [_Leviathan, or, The Whale_](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22_Leviathan%2C%20or%2C%20The%20Whale_%22%20amazon.com): "Right now, as you read this, whale oil lubricates the Hubble Space Telescope, 'while the Voyager probe spins into infinity playing the song of the humpback to greet any friendly aliens—who may wonder at our treatment of the species with which we share our planet.'
