    In shadows they thrive,  
    Homes of hope and struggle soar,  
    Life's pulse in the dust.

> One _billion_ people live in slums. Their numbers are supposed to double over the next quarter-century. So: Who _are_ those people ‚Äî and what must their lives be like?

> The Norwegian photojournalist Jonas Bendiksen has spent a good deal of time in Indian, Kenyan, Indonesian, and Venezuelan slums, and his website, The Places We Live, features [dazzling 360-degree photos of homes and shanties, navigable and altogether immersive,](http://web.archive.org/web/20200605113749/http://www.theplaceswelive.com/) along with audio recordings made by the inhabitants. Prepare yourself to gape, gasp, laugh, cry, and experience every emotion in between: In Mumbai, you‚Äôll meet the Shilpiri family (15 people crammed into a tiny space through which floodwater and garbage regularly stream). In Nairobi, the head of the Dirango household takes great pride in his cramped abode, giving a tour that takes just seconds. ‚ÄúYou have to visit somewhere before you judge,‚Äù he explains. Thanks, Mr. Bendiksen, for starting us on the journey
