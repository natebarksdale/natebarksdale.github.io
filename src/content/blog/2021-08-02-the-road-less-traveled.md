  Yellow wood holds paths
  The poem first takes its hold
  Which road beckons now?

> August 2, 1915. The poem appears in print for the first time this week, from Kentucky to Pennsylvania to Vermont. Every reader is transported to that same leafy path: ‚Äútwo roads diverged in a yellow wood.‚Äù The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost becomes an immediate hit and will go on to become one of the most popular and well-known poems in American history. For many, it's about a spirit of individualism -- forging one‚Äôs own path. And yet‚Ä¶ Robert Frost may have had a completely different meaning in mind. What‚Äîor who‚Äîinspired Frost to write this iconic poem? And what is it really telling us about how to make a choice?
