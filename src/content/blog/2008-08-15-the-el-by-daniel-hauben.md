One of six colored-glass panels at the [Freeman Street Station](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=bronx+freeman+street&sll=40.844126,-73.888561&sspn=0.085448,0.142479&ie=UTF8&ll=40.83396,-73.890975&spn=0.010683,0.01781&t=h&z=16&layer=c&cbll=40.830136,-73.891489&panoid=12kHBHfq1UdMVjUQkUuTPg&cbp=1,276.0350745935459,,0,-15.788482430268262) in the Bronx. The medium is a sturdier version of stained glass, with inch-thick colored segments joined together with epoxy. I love, obviously, the vibrancy of the panels, and the fact that they're a celebration of, basically, the neighborhood just below the station (which you can glimpse through that gap below the partition) -- saying, in effect, this isn't just a way-station on your journey to somewhere else, but a Place in itself
