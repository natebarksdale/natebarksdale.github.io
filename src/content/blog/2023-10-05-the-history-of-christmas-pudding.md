> In America, Christmas Pudding (also known as plum pudding or figgy pudding) is a dish as famous as it is misunderstood. It’s the flaming center of the climactic meal of Charles Dickens’ _A Christmas Carol_, and pops up in carols themselves: “We Wish You a Merry Christmas” has two whole verses about demanding figgy pudding.
