description: A remarkable press conference delivered by a survivor of jungle captivity, reflecting on her emotional rescue experience. "The helicopter almost fell from the sky, because we were jumping, shouting, crying, embracing, we couldn't believe it. God has done a miracle for us -- and it's a miracle that I wanted to share with all of you, because all of you have suffered with my family, with my children, with me."

  Years in the shadows,  
  Hope soars with a chopper's roar,  
  Love conquers the dark.

To endure years of jungle captivity and then give a post-rescue press conference as graceful (in multiple senses) as this ... it's just amazing. Yes, it's all in Spanish, but just listen to her tone as she describes the moment of rescue (2:25 in). "The helicopter almost fell from the sky, because we were jumping, shouting, crying, embracing, we couldn't believe it. God has done a miracle for us -- and it's a miracle that I wanted to share with all of you, because all of you have suffered with my family, with my children, with me
