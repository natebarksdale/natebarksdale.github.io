  Sweet wrappers forgotten,  
  Names etched on littered ground,  
  Clean streets, children found.

A Gloucestershire, UK shopkeeper has found a partial solution to the tragedy of the commons: de-commodifying the village children's litter. It helps that her community is small enough that she knows most of the kids by name (and that they don't have many other options for their snack food needs when she cuts them off). In this [video clip](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7953144.stm), she says that the litterers she catches nearly always prefer 10 minutes of trash pickup to a multiday candy ban
