For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about the implications of seemingly impossible cosmic coincidences.

> A woman enters a casino, sits down at a high-stakes poker table, and draws a royal flush. She cashes in her winnings, walks to the casino next door, and does the same thing. Then she goes to a third casino and draws a third royal flush. What is a dispassionate observer to make of this scenario? Is it merely a highly improbable occurrence (although no more improbable — just more lucrative — than drawing the same losing hand three times over)? Casinos may believe that in general one person in a thousand is a cheater while the rest play with random hands. But the fact of our player’s lucky streak should significantly shift the likelihood that the alternative ‘cheater’ hypothesis is correct.

> John Hawthorne is a philosopher at USC who studies the intricacies of epistemology — the field that examines how we come to our beliefs, and when those beliefs are justified. In recent years, he’s been thinking about what a careful epistemologist might have to say about certain coincidences — some of which seem far more unlikely than a triple-royal-flush — that have recently been observed in particle physics and related fields. Most of these coincidences have to do with the very specific values of universal constants — the masses of subatomic particles, the strengths of atomic forces, or the value of a physical parameter known as the cosmological constant — which seem to be highly improbable from the perspective of physics, but upon whose precise values the entire possibility of a galaxy-filled, life-sustaining universe seems to hang.
