  New art embraces  
  A struggle revered now,  
  Words too easy fade.

Non-gamer that I am, I feel less qualified to comment. Well, back to my difficult books I guess

a [NYTimes.com Ideas Blog](http://ideas.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/pm-edition-are-computer-games-art/) post, 23 December 2008

> **Culture |** Why computer games are a throwback to art of the past: they revive “the idea that difficulty is artistically desirable,” a critic [says](http://web.archive.org/web/20091001212543/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/lanc01_.html). “It’s a bit of an irony that difficulty thrives in the newest medium of all—and it’s not by accident, either. One of the most common complaints regular gamers make in reviewing new offerings is that they are too easy. (It would be nice if a little bit of that leaked over into the book world.)” [[London Review of Books](http://web.archive.org/web/20091001212543/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/lanc01_.html)]
