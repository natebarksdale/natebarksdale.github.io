University of Colorado psychologist Geoffrey Cohen has done a couple of studies showing an easy way to help black students perform better on standardized tests. Simply having them spend 15 minutes [writing about a value they held dear](http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2009/04/simple-psychological-intervention.html) (family, music, sports, politics, friends, art), either right before the exam or just several times a semester, led to a jump in test scores compared to peers (majority culture students did not experience a similar boost). Meanwhile, a study from Radbound University Nijmegen showed that students playing a computerized word game [performed better if they took a step backward](http://web.archive.org/web/20230318173239/https://www.ru.nl/aspx/download.aspx?File=/contents/pages/173707/manuscript_psychscience.pdf) before each round than if they took a step to the side or no step at all.
