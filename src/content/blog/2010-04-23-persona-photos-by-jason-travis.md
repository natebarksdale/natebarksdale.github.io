TMN's link-description for this photo series nails it: "Pictures of what (extremely similar) Atlantans carry around in their bags". Once you get over your wish that the photographer had cast his net a little more broadly, there's still a lot of interest and wit here. The things these people carry at once offer us a view of people's public personae and a peek into what remains hidden. There's a whole gigantic "[What's in your bag?](http://www.flickr.com/groups/whats_in_your_bag/pool/)" photo pool on flickr, a reminder that this sort of hiding/sharing/defining is [by no means limited](http://koranteng.blogspot.com/2007/04/bags-and-stamps.html) to hipsters in Atlanta.
