  Films bring joy to all.

It is my new theory that all news is better when accompanied by a garland of marigolds. From the photoblogger: "There's three hours to go before Sudeep's latest film '[Veera Madakari](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdRYK-cmKTI)' opens and Kapali Theater in Gandhinagar, the heart of the Kannada Film Industry is House - Full. That's sad news for a fan who woke up late, but good news for the producer, Dinesh Gandhi, as you can see from the garland on the House-Full signboard."
