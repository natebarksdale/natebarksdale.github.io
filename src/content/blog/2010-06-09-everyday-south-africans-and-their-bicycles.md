Upon viewing the new Shakira [World Cup song's video](http://web.archive.org/web/20100611071119/http://worldcup.vevo.com:80/?v=wakawaka), an African historian friend of mine tweeted "Planning to cringe all month w/ South Africa standing in as the 'real Africa.' Drums + Feathers anyone?" Hopefully the soccer coverage will dig a bit deeper than that, or at least provide the world with a few urban African cliches to balance out the rural ones. On a more positive note, I really like these portraits of South African cyclists, which are paired with interviews about the pictured bikes and (as if they hadn't won my heart already), Google Maps pinpointing each photo's exact location. The photographers are [raising money](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22raising%20money%22%20kickstarter.com) to publish a hardcover book of the portraits.
