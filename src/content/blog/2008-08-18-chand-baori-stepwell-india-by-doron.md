  Deep stone stairs descend,  
  Water beckons all to come,  
  History in steps.

This is a 9th-century stepwell in western India, 100 feet deep, with 3500 steps in 13 tiers. Though it would take some sort of Q-bert-style planning to actually go up and down all 3500. The multiple approaches to the water source hint at the well's social function -- lots of people can descend at once to the cool (and, perhaps in its day somewhat less greenish) waters
