![image](http://culture-making.com/media/2009-09-25-NBarksdale-mangosteen.jpg)I have a new article up today on [comment magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20250112200244/http://www.cardus.ca/comment)'s website, about my favorite (or as they say in Canadian, favourite) fruit, the mangosteen. The catch to my favoritism: [I've never actually tasted one](http://web.archive.org/web/20101229133820/http://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/1196/)
