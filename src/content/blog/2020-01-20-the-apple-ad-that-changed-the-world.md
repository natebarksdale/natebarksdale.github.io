I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0M47oFG4gqVzr1iUIVv4qO?si=fux-3kOBTJ-0e6NPXsSpxg) for The History Channel. A perfect storm of both my long-term Apple fandom (I think of them as my sports team, for better and worse!) and my obsession with the claim that anything "changed the world." I got to dive into the technicalities of which parts of the early Apple operation were indeed "out of a garage" and do some ever-fun "in-today's dollars" price checks.

> January 22, 1984. Apple launches the first Macintosh computer, with a showstopping Super Bowl commercial. The ad itself was revolutionary, but the product it launched almost single-handedly brought computers into the mainstream, changing the world as we know it.
