#### Wimbo Zuri Catalog No. 046.1A09-1

For the past several years, my friend Robyn has taken part part in the [Avon Walk for Breast Cancer](http://web.archive.org/web/20141222030242/http://www.avonwalk.org/) in Colorado. I designed this mix CD, of peppy, hopeful, walk-appropriate songs, for her to use as a giveaway to her most generous donors.
