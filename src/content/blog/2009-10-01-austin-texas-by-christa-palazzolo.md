  A calm gaze holds truth,

  Canvas speaks softly.

I really like this striking oversize portrait. A lot of Palazzolo's other portraiture is more distanced and ironic (including a striking series of Great Historical Women depicted as glamorous contemporary sex symbols), but this guy's placid stare is the opposite of glamor, revealing rather than concealing.
