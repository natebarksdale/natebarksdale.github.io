I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5HRI6FGU1sTsY4O8dCCmYz?si=pCx5bQpZTHmWd_upKWBZ-A) for The History Channel. Among other things I had to deal with the intricies of when exactly India became a British colony (the process was gradual) and all-important questions of accurate statue height.

> April 25, 1859. About 150 people have gathered on the shores of Lake Manzala in Egypt. And one of them, a mustachioed, retired French diplomat, steps forward. He raises his pickaxe and strikes a ceremonial blow. The audacious goal is to cut through the desert to connect the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, creating a new trade route between the East and the West. Changing global trade and geopolitics forever. Today: the Suez Canal. Why did the tremendous efforts of a Frenchman end up enriching the British Empire? And how, decades later, did the canal play an unexpected role in the birth of modern Egypt?
