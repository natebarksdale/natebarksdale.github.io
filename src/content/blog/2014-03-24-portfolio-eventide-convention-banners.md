slug: portfolio-eventide-convention-banners
featured: false
draft: false
description: I had the opportunity to create these full-height banners for the Eventide Funds booth at a national convention of financial planners. Rarely has a banner so large had so many footnotes, but the finance industry loves (and requires) these things.

  Banners stand so tall,  
  Numbers dance with footnotes found,  
  Finance takes the stage.
