  Brush strokes tell a tale,

Here's the promo for the third episode of the TV version of [This American Life](http://www.thislife.org/TV_Episode.aspx?episode=3), which I've been watching now that it's up on Netflix. The full 30min. story of this painter and his models is, as one would expect from Ira Glass and Nancy Updike, fascinating and beautiful. For me it was also a welcome reminder that it isn't that hard to see the image of the outcast even in such a cringingly Caucasian representation of Jesus
