This is just to say we've started cross-posting everything from this blog on the [@culturemaking](http://twitter.com/culturemaking) twitter feed. It's less pretty than the site, and less informative than the [RSS Feed](http://www.culture-making.com/tumblelog/atom/), but for those so inclined, we hope you'll follow, retweet and reply at will.
