  Dandies intertwined,

  History remixed.

The Nigerian-British artist Yinka Shonibare has made a whole fascinating series of race/class remix sculptures featuring mannequins of 18th-century European dandies dressed in period clothing cut from "African" Dutch-wax fabrics (made in Manchester and the Netherlands, purchased by the artist in Brixton Market, London). He's currently got a big exhibition up at the [Brooklyn Museum](http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/yinka_shonibare_mbe/).
