From a delicious series of national-cuisines-as-national-flags dreamed and plated up to promote the Sydney International Food Festival. Other mouthwatering banners include Italy, Brazil, France, Korea, and Switzerland. Sadly, no African countries/cuisines are represented—perhaps we can get [BetumiBlog](http://www.betumi.com/blog.html) on the case.
