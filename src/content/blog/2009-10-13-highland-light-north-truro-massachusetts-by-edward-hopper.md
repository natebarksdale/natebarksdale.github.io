  Lighthouse stands alone,  
  Outbuildings hug the shoreline,  
  Nature's silent watch.

This painting combines my favorite sides of Edward Hopper's work: somewhat desolate places (rather than somewhat desolate people), and quick outdoor sketching (rather than more formal and detailed composition). I love how many outbuildings this particular Cape Cod lighthouse has managed to attract—it looks more like the grain silo of a farm than an outpost against seas and storms.
