I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/51I0qLPp3f4ewVNav73Qkf?si=HwRFafmOQC6WuuOlx58cKQ) for The History Channel.

> June 21, 1998. Father's Day. At the Church of the Atonement in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, Jon and Michael Galluccio are ready to tie the knot, in front of family, friends, reporters, and one lone picketer. The Galluccios are already public figures—a few months earlier, they had secured the right for gay and unmarried couples to jointly adopt children. And today, they pull up to their wedding in a minivan, with their son in tow: as a family. How did this family come together? And how did their son's adoption end up changing the lives of other families all across the country?
