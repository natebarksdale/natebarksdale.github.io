  Amidst the laughter,  
  Gems in romantic tales shine,  
  Love's art, not rubbish.

I love the 95% rule of thumb: so inherently unverifiable, yet so pleasing!

> If you were on the Internet this week you probably heard that [love can no longer exist in the age of the romantic comedy](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7784366.stm). But like all cultural artifacts, while 95% of the output is rubbish, there are some real gems. I love [Sliding Doors](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Sliding%20Doors%22%20amazon.com) and [Bridget Jones’ Diary](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bridget%20Jones%E2%80%99%20Diary%22%20amazon.com) isn’t all that bad. [Next Stop Wonderland](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Next%20Stop%20Wonderland%22%20amazon.com) is one of my all-time favorite movies. (NYT captures it perfectly in this [1998 review](https://www.google.com/search?q=%221998%20review%22%20nytimes.com).) [Little Black Book](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Little%20Black%20Book%22%20amazon.com) is actually a weird [Network](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Network%22%20amazon.com)-inspired satire and I’d consider Neil LaBute ’s [The Shape of Things](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22The%20Shape%20of%20Things%22%20amazon.com) a rom-com too. To believe the genre is inherently stupid is like dismissing horror because Eli Roth makes movies.
