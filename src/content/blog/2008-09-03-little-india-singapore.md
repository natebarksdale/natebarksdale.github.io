It is, after all, [backpacks week](http://www.culture-making.com/five_questions/backpacks) at Culture Making. I don't think of the Prince of Wales as being much of a backpacker (except in the sense of toting your watercolors across the deer park). But then again I don't much think of Braveheart when I want to check my email, either
