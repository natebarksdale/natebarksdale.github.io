  Warlpiri colors gleam,  
  Dogwood tree whispers secrets,  
  Nature's vibrant dream.

I was looking at info on Warlpiri culture while editing Christy's [latest post](http://www.culture-making.com/post/1627/) (see below) and came upon this beautiful painting by a contemporary Warlpiri artist. I love the array of colors—the pink stripes on the right get me every time. From the gallery statement: "The main motif of this painting depicts the ‘wakirlpirri’ (dogwood [Acacia coriacea]) tree. ‘Wakirlpirri’ is a very useful tree that grows on the sides of creek beds and near ‘mulga’ trees. The seeds of this tree can be eaten raw or cooked on the fire. A deliciously sweet drink called ‘yinjirrpi’ is made from the seeds when they have been dried. The wood can be used to make weapons such as ‘karli’ (boomerangs) and dancing boards for ceremonies. It is also good wood for burning on the fire because rain cannot extinguish burning Wakirlpirri wood. In contemporary Warlpiri paintings traditional iconography is used to represent the Jukurrpa, particular sites and other elements."
