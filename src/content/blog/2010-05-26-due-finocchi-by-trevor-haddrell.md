  Fennel sails so proud,  
  Art in wood, nature's grace,  
  A galleon's embrace.

Now that's some handsome fennel—the majestic composition reminds me of a Spanish galleon at full sail. I love this Bristol, UK artist's botanical and culinary wood engravings. You can buy this one (by printing out an order form and mailing it in!) from the storied Society of Wood Engravers, or seek out a copy of Haddrell's book, [Asparagus and Other Friends](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Asparagus%20and%20Other%20Friends%22%20amazon.com).
