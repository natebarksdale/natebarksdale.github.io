  A giant worm sleeps,  
  Concrete winds through the bustling,  
  Peace blooms on Sundays.

Photo of the Minhoc√£o elevated expressway in central S√£o Paulo, built in the 1970s to relieve congestion but only uncongested itself on Sundays, when it's closed for traffic and becomes a sort of public park. [Here's a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh_m88dujnk) of what it looks like on weekdays. I'd heard that the name just meant "big worm" in Portuguese, but it turns out there's a whole bigfoot-type legend of a truly giant [minhoc√£o](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minhoc%C3%A3o) tunneling somewhere in the jungles of South America. The photographer is originally from Mexico and has worked extensively there and in Europe and Brazil.
