Honestly I find myself wanting to just remove the nation from the equation entirely: Great Art Makes (and Deserves!) Great Art. A tautology, but one whose causality I can wholeheartedly affirm

> [The National Endowment for the Arts]'s [current slogan](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922152102/http://www.nea.gov/) is "A Great Nation Deserves Great Art." _Wince._ That imperial bit of provincial pomposity has things exactly backward. Here's a new NEA motto: "Great Art Makes a Great Nation." After all, that is how it works
