  Hands mold the essence,  
  In crafting, we find our tone,  
  Hearts grow with true care.

I don’t think the workshops taught me too much about craft, but they did teach me about the importance of making things, not just reading things. You care about things that you make, and that makes it easier to care about things that other people make.
