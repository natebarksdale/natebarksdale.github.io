  Knitting for peace,  
  Threads weaving front and home,  
  Crafting hope in war.

This is a sentence I wasn't expecting to see today. It's from a British WWII poster from the collection of the [Imperial War Museum](http://web.archive.org/web/20061004045231/http://www.iwmcollections.org.uk/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?AC=NEXT_RECORD). I'm not sure if it actually represented an efficient way of getting socks to soldiers, or if its purpose was primarily for morale-building at home, to connect domestic acts with the struggle abroad. The very clever poster is by the great mid-century British designer [Abram Games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abram_Games). The blog post where I found it is also quite wonderful, full of visual and thematic references linking knitting, espionage, escape, and stilt-walking (and more specifically, [knitting on stilts](http://www.abelard.org/france/les_landes_forestry_industry1.php)).
