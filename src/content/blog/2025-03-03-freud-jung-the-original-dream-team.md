  Thirteen hours shared—
  minds map the unconscious deep,
  friends, then fractured paths.

I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5dxGeK2EQzEZWE5lyKsrT9?si=ETNBZa14RzSeSHf6husb5g) for The History Channel. Along-the-way discoveries included figuring out just who first called it "the talking cure," and figuring out the day-to-day itinerary of Freud and Jung's American tour — who waited for whom, and when.

> March 3rd, 1907. Dr. Sigmund Freud invites a guest into his office, Dr. Carl Jung. This is a meeting of the minds, about... the mind. Psychology. Freud and Jung will spend the next 13 hours discussing the unconscious, the hidden forces in our brains that guide our thoughts and decisions. They're two of the first doctors to explore this mysterious terrain, and this marathon meeting will spark a true friendship – until it all comes crashing down.
> How did Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung help shape the way we understand the human mind, that elusive unconscious? And why did their friendship eventually fall apart?
