  Sandbags stacked with care,  
  Skilled hands rise to hold the tide,  
  Knowledge builds the wall.

I wonder whether they could even out the results by getting the engineers to write some new sandbagging directions?

> Researchers at the University of Manitoba conducted [an experiment](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22an%20experiment%22%20apegm.mb.ca) (PDF) in which they asked two groups—one made up of professional engineers, the other of volunteers given standard instructions—to construct a dike using standard sandbags. The professionals were able to create a sandbag dike 12 feet tall that proved quite effective. But the 6-foot-tall dike prepared by the unsupervised volunteers failed when the water reached its peak level.
