  Tiles of thanks shine bright,  
  Vows fulfilled in humble grace,  
  Time in style unfolds.

Not sure where in France this photo was taken—presumably at some Catholic shrine, the tiles expressing thanks for answered prayers. I love how the type styles have varied over time. [![photo](http://culture-making.com/media/merci.jpg)](http://vernacular.free.fr/blog/index.php?2009/04/22/599-merci)
