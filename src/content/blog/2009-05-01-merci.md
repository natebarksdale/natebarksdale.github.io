  Tiles of thanks shine bright,

  Time in style unfolds.

Not sure where in France this photo was taken—presumably at some Catholic shrine, the tiles expressing thanks for answered prayers. I love how the type styles have varied over time. [![photo](http://culture-making.com/media/merci.jpg)](http://vernacular.free.fr/blog/index.php?2009/04/22/599-merci)
