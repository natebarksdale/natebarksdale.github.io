  In art’s embrace here,  
  She melds with colors and shape,  
  Thought and canvas flow.

I'm not sure I'm as into this particular painting as this young woman in the photo, but I love the depiction of art-contemplation -- and the bodily symmetry: is the art falling into her, or is she falling into the art? I also appreciate the fact that she's away from the museum description on the wall, taking it in on her own (well, and the bench-placement-department's) terms
