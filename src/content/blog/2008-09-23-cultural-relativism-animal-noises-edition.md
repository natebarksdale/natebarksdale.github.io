  Frogs croak differently,

> ![Frogs](http://culture-making.com/media/1222113518-frogs_210.jpg)Bzzzpeek is an engaging little website that‚Äôll play you clips of kids from various different countries making the sounds they think dogs, lions, and other common animals make. There seems to be very little disagreement across cultures about what cats say. Frogs, however, are another story entirely. And fair enough: the American ‚Äúribbit‚Äù is a pretty strange set of syllables to assign to frog noises. [See bzzzpeek here](http://www.flat33.com/bzzzpeek/index1.html#).
