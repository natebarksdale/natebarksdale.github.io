The hard work of a certain sort of vocal cultivation

> New York is full of vocal coaches who help polish pipes, but [Melissa] Cross is one of a kind â€“ she doesnâ€™t teach singing; she teaches screaming. Her students â€“ the heavy-metal faithful â€“ generally donâ€™t know from show tunes or arias. They come to her femininely soothing studio â€“ filled with paper lanterns and Buddha figures â€“ to wail with confidence.

> As basic as it may seem, screaming is not just that primal complaint every baby learns in the crib. Itâ€™s as much an art as, say, hitting an A flat with no hitches. Guns and Rosesâ€™ Axl Rose and Aerosmithâ€™s Steven Tyler donâ€™t just find their inner beasts without a vocal compass. Screaming takes skill.
