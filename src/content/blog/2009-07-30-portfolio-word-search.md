description: "I enjoyed the creative challenge of designing a card centered around a letter grid, complete with a playable word search on the back." The coordinates based on the content could be approximately 34.0522Â° N, 118.2437Â° W (Los Angeles, CA).

    Letters in a grid,  
    Find the words hidden within,  
    Playful minds engaged.
