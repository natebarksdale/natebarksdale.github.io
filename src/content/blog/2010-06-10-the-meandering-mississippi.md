  Meanders unfold time,  
  Nature's brush on water's course,  
  Flow of life's pattern.

This bit of virtuoso cartography overlays the meanders and jumps taken by the [lower Mississippi River](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Cape+Girardeau,+MO&daddr=Donaldsonville,+LA&hl=en&geocode=&mra=ls&sll=37.305884,-89.518148&sspn=0.163576,0.421944&g=Cape+Girardeau,+MO&ie=UTF8&z=6) over the past few thousand years. The time-compression inherent in geography always boggles the mind. I love how it looks like a mix between an abstract expressionist painting and an intestinal diagram.
