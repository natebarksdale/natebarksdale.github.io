  Eyes darting, screens fly,  
  Crafting tales in real-time,  
  Games unfold through lenses.

Think of narrative and televised sports and you'll usually call to mind pre-produced soft-focus athlete featurettes, or perhaps the verbal litany of setup and description and trivia from the commentators' box. But the real heart of the story belongs to the broadcast director..

> There’s a wonderful [article](http://www.theatlantic.com//doc/200901/football-television) in the new _Atlantic_ by Mark Bowden called “The Hardest Job in Football.” That hardest job is being the director of a television broadcast of a game. Bowden focuses on a man named Bob Fishman, whom he believes to be the best at this job, as Fishman sits in a control room before a bank of TV screens. Each screen shows what one of the many cameras scattered around the stadium is seeing, and Fishman’s job during the game is to scan that bank of screens and decide what the guy watching the game at home on his TV should be seeing at any given moment. It’s fascinating to think what cognitive skills make someone good at this. You have to be able to take in the import of an image in a millisecond — a moving image! — and, in a few milliseconds more, evaluate it in relation to all the other images you’re viewing. But can only do this well not by thinking of the intrinsic visual interest of a particular image, but rather by having in mind a narrative structure, a sense of what the game is _about_ — and not just what it’s about in some general sense, but what it’s about at _this particular moment._ And that will vary according to whether a team is ahead or behind; whether they are deep in their own territory or deep in the opponents’; whether it’s near the beginning or the end of the game; even what stories have been in the news leading up to the game. The director’s narrative sense, then, needs to govern his visual sense. Fascinating stuff
