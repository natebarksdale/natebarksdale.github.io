  Washington's embrace,

  Grunge left far behind.

#### Wimbo Zuri Catalog No. 049.1A09-1

From the [**50 States!**](https://www.natebarksdale.com/?tag=states) series of CDs, commissioned for a friend who works in the Skagit Valley, north of Seattle. This mix is notable both for including references to parts of the state far from Puget Sound (Spokane, Pullman), and for including exactly zero grunge tracks, no small feat.
