  In the kitchen's hum,  
  Sacred in the mundane toil,  
  God within the dish.

A writer I once worked with referred to the 17th-Century French monastery worker [Brother Lawrence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brother_Lawrence) as "The Patron Saint of Doing the Dishes." These simple and lovely press-dry sponges call to mind the discipline of Lawrence's particular practice of messy, cleansing culture-keeping. "The time of business," [said he](http://books.google.com/books?id=5CY3AAAAMAAJ&dq=brother+lawrence+site:books.google.com&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=9afzhrTMgB&sig=iLL9vwOkSmLrAKJ3hLEWtvx6acg&hl=en&ei=LVz8Sv6EA4K6swOF7YSPAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&q=kitchen&f=false), "does not with me differ from the time of prayer, and in the noise and clatter of my kitchen, while several persons are at the same time calling for different things, I possess God in as great tranquillity as if I were upon my knees at the blessed sacrament."
