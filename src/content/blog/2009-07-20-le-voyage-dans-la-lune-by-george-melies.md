  Silent journeys soar,

  Moonlight marks the way.

Never mind the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11: this year marks the 107th anniversary of cinematic pioneer [George Méliès](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s)' 1902 silent film, Le voyage dans la Lune, about a trip to the moon by men in frock coats. I suggest watching this as a warm-up to this [synchronized tv rebroadcast](http://kottke.org/apollo-11/) of the 1969 moon landing this evening. The visual parallels, from a Mission Control populated by wizards to the final splashdown, are most pleasing
