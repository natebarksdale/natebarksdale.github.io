  Piles of distraction,  
  Stinking truths of our lives grow,  
  Beauty in the mess.

garbage has to be the poem of our time because  
garbage is spiritual, believable enough

to get our attention, getting in the way, piling  
up, stinking, turning brooks brownish and

creamy white: what else deflects us from the  
errors of our illusionary ways, not a temptation

to trashlessness, that is too far off, and,  
anyway, unimaginable, unrealistic.
