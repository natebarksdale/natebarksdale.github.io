From a documentary film that features a whole series of similar global collaborations. A bit like a more musician-collaborative version of Kutiman's brilliant [ThruYOU](http://thru-you.com/#/videos/1/) YouTube mash-ups. In both cases, if you listen with your eyes shut you're liable to think "too many instruments!!", but in video form, it's pure multitude-containing jump cut musical joy
