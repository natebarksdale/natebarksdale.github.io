Here's what happens when you set a video camera on a plate at a kaiten (conveyor belt) sushi restaurant in [Tomakomai, Hokkaido, Japan](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Tomakomai,+Hokkaido). Really amazing and surprisingly plotty (worth the full 7:39): culture-keeping (and consuming) at its best. All it needs is the right retro-indie soundtrack and it would fit right into a Wes Anderson film
