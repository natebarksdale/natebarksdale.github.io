I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0PA2Y9NfkDx4Fytt1qJrR2?si=MooYjiRjRA2xsOHMqVty5g) for The History Channel.

> December 28, 2020. In this year-end recap, Sally sits down with HISTORY This Week producers McCamey Lynn, Julie Magruder and Ben Dickstein to discuss their favorite episodes from 2020 and bonus info that didn’t make it into the episodes. Plus, we’ll hear researcher Emma Frederick’s favorite facts from a year’s worth of deep dives. You can find the links to all relevant episodes below. We’re back next week to kick off Season 2 with a very special guest.
