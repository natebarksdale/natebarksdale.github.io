  Young king claims the world,
  Beyond the conquest, seeks rule:
  Destiny takes hold.

I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3CKazsp3W9wUm3tvcCotOl?si=NHUyVjgoR-GuSBnV5ay4_Q) for The History Channel. It's always a challenge to wordsmith orienting references to present-day geopolitics without the prose tripping over "in what is now known as Pakistan,"

> November 14, 332 BCE. Alexander the Great has conquered an unprecedented amount of territory in a relatively short amount of time. At just 24 years old, he's in control of Macedonia, much of Greece, and now, a huge part of Egypt.
>
> But Alexander doesn't want to just conquer each of these places - he wants to rule. And in a rare move for Macedonian royalty, he wants to rule in a way that honors local customs, allowing him to be seen as not just a king, but in some areas, as some kind of divine figure. So today, the ancient Egyptians will crown Alexander as a pharaoh.
>
> This is one in a long line of victories for Alexander the Great. However, in his often-overlooked later years, his luck starts to change. As Alexander continues his quest to reach the end of the known world, and his ambition reaches mythical heights, how will his unparalleled success come to an end?
