You can read most of Benjamin's essay at [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=A4tRaJK85n8C&lpg=PA143&dq=walter%20benjamin%20%22the%20storyteller%22&pg=PA145#v=onepage&q=walter%20benjamin%20%22the%20storyteller%22&f=false). The first few pages are all quite good and require no knowledge whatsoever of that [Nikolai Leskov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Leskov) fellow

> All this points to the nature of every real story. It contains, openly or covertly, something useful. The usefulness may, in one case, consist in a moral; in another, in some practical advice; in a third, in a proverb or maxim. In every case the storyteller is a man who has counsel for his readers. But if today ‚Äúhaving counsel‚Äù is beginning to have an old-fashioned ring, this is because the communicability of experience is decreasing. In consequence we have no counsel either for ourselves or for others. After all, counsel is less an answer to a question than a proposal concerning the continuation of a story which is just unfolding. To seek this counsel one would first have to be able to tell the story. (Quite apart from the fact that a man is receptive to counsel only to the extent that he allows his situation to speak.) Counsel woven into the fabric of real life is wisdom
