  Old bridge starts to sway,
  River flows beneath the weight,
  Timeless, fragile span.

The Hammersmith Bridge crosses the Thames in West London, linking the boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham and Richmond-upon-Thames. The original span, completed in 1827, was the first suspension bridge over the Thames, was damaged by a boat and replaced in the 1870s with a similar span, which has persisted to the present day as a Grade II-listed structure very much unsuited to the needs of modern vehicular traffic. Often closed for various repairs and strengthenings, it bounces noticably as buses pass over, and during the July 2022 heat wave its chains had to be wrapped in foil and cooled with special air-conditioning to keep them from cracking.
