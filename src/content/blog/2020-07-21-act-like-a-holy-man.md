  Two souls meet and speak,  
  Joy blooms from shared suffering,  
  Peace weaves through their words.

For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about the intertwining journeys of Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama as they explore the essence of joy and suffering.

> In April of 2015, Desmond Tutu, the Anglican Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town, flew to Dharamsala, India to spend five days with his friend (and fellow [Templeton Prize laureate](https://www.templetonprize.org/templeton-prize-winners/)) Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama. Their recorded conversations — more than 23 hours worth — became the basis for the 2016 _New York Times_ bestseller [The Book of Joy](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/533718/the-book-of-joy-by-his-holiness-the-dalai-lama-and-archbishop-desmond-tutu-with-douglas-abrams/)_,_ co-authored with Douglas Abrams. Now, Abrams, activist and film producer Peggy Callahan and Academy Award-winning director Louie Psihoyos, backed with funding including $500,000 from the John Templeton Foundation, are at work on _Act Like a Holy Man,_ a feature-length documentary about Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama’s intersecting life stories and the lessons they have learned — often through suffering — about the nature of joy and happiness.

> The film’s interlocking narrative arcs will trace the two men’s biographies interspersed by footage from their conversations in Dharamsala. Born in Klerksdorp, South Africa in 1931, Tutu gained renown as a minister, theologian, leader in South Africa’s anti-apartheid movement, and driving force for the country’s post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Enthroned as spiritual leader of the Tibetan Buddhism at age four in 1940, the 14th Dalai Lama has lived as a refugee in India since he was exiled during the 1959 Tibetan Uprising. Since then, the Dalai Lama has been a global religious and political leader, advocating for the Tibetan people and pressing for the cause of nonviolence and religious harmony. [Tutu](https://www.templetonprize.org/laureate/desmond-tutu/) was awarded the Templeton Prize in 2013; the [Dalai Lama](https://www.templetonprize.org/laureate/tenzin-gyatso-the-14th-dalai-lama/) received the award in 2012.
