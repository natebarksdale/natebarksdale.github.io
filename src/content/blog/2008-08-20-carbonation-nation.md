  In each region’s tongue,  
  A fizzy drink’s name diverges,  
  Culture in a sip.

Results of an online survey which got more than 120,000 answers to the question, "What's your local name for a generic soft drink?" Click through for a slightly-less-shrunken version; the yellow varients are "soda"; the blues are "pop"; the reds are (of course) "coke", the greens are "other" (e.g. "dope," "tonic," and of course "soft drink"). I'd love to see an international version of the survey, with my favorite "cooldrink" predominating in India and elsewhere
