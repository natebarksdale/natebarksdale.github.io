It's easy to think of the hermit as someone who chooses to remove themselves from culture. While I suppose by Andy's definition it's difficult to make a culture of one, few hermits are truly that alone—nor should they be. There is culture-among-hermits, as in even the most removed contemplative orders; but the hermit's place in the larger culture has often been one not of culture-rejecter but culture-keeper

> Buddhist-Christian dialogue seems awfully passé to me in an era when positive dialogue seems all too scarce among Muslims, Christians, and Jews, on the one hand, and between crusading atheists and theists of all stripes, on the other.

For example, hermit shrine keepers were numerous throughout Christian cultures for centuries; most of these were simple laity without whom many pilgrimage sites would simply not have existed, and their identity has not yet found a modern voice. The massively popular pilgrimage churches of traditional Catholicism had at their heart the hermit-sacristan who tended the lamps and swept the floors. The professed hermit monk, the monastic hermit order, and the shrine hermit all found expression in the legal and the architectural boundaries of medieval and early modern societies.”
