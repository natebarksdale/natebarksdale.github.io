  Maps of votes align,  
  Night lights reflect the truth,  
  Patterns in the dark.

Among all the fascinating maps that've been made of the US voting patterns for the 2008 presidential election, I couldn't find the one I really wanted to see: a map showing both voter percentages and population density on an undistorted projection. With fancy databases it wouldn't be hard to do, but I did come up with a way to Photoshop an approximation, combining the red-blue-purple county-percentage map from the [University of Michigan](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/) with the famous satellite image of [nighttime illumination](http://web.archive.org/web/20130220190722/http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dmsp/night_light_posters.html). It's not a total match for population—gas flares get counted as voters, for instance—but it comes closer than anything I'd found
