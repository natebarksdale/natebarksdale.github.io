An encouraging use of the world's fastest-spreading technology, from India's Bihar state, which has a reputation for backwardness even during non-flood times

> [One India](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112103520/http://news.oneindia.in/) reports on how mobile phones are used after the devastating floods in Bihar, India. While relief and aid have been very slow to get to Bihar, mobiles are proving to be a life saver. According to One India, ‚Äú[Mobiles] are playing the most crucial role in largescale evacuation and rescue of marooned people from far flung areas. The availability of mobile phones to all sections of people across the flooded regions and their 24 hour connectivity during the crisis period, greatly helped the rescue teams to locate the cut off villages and localities besides saving many lives even from remote areas.‚ÄùThrough cell phones the marnooed people were also able to remain connected with the district officials to guide them about their need and the urgency of rescuing them
