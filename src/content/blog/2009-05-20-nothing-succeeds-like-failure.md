  Cures that deceive us,

I find this hypothesis to be a little too clean, a bit of wishfully rationalistic sleight of hand that ignores the huge role that psychology, folklore, and culture in general play in forming people's approaches to medicine. Incidentally, [snake oil has gotten a bad rap](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=snake-oil-salesmen-knew-something), says _Scientific American_.

> **Behavior |** From eating vultures to clear up syphilis to treating H.I.V. with garlic and beetroot, quack medicine persists in folk remedies around the world, [writes](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22writes%22) Ewen Callaway in New Scientist. Now an Australian study describes the cascades of human gullibility that help explain why. Put simply, person X uses snake oil to treat her goiter, arthritis or what have you. Seeing this, friends assume snake oil works and more follow suit. Since it doesn’t work and X persists in using snake oil, more gullible people are exposed to the folly and fall for it than if X had been quickly cured with effective treatment. Four out of five hucksters couldn’t have done better. [[New Scientist](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22%5BNew%20Scientist%22)]
