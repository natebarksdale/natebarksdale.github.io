I just finished reading a copy of _[Schindler's List](http://web.archive.org/web/20241225210359/https://www.amazon.com/Schindlers-List-Thomas-Keneally/dp/0671880314)_ from my local library. I'd hoped they would have the original, British edition, when the title was still _[Schindler's Ark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_Ark)_ but the movie-tie-in US printing did just as well, and included some surprise annotations on the nature of history and fiction, which I don't agree with but find charming nonetheless. Nice to be reminded one's place in a line of book-handlers past and future
