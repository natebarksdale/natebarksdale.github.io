  Friends and parents play,

  Screens fade far away.

Furniture maker IKEA commissioned a research organization to interview 11,000 parents and children in 25 countries in Europe, North America, Australia, and East Asia to find out their thoughts on children, families, and play ([Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Make-the-world-play-more-Playreport-USA/124553714222962?v=app_112957172077213), [PDF](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22PDF%22%20playreport.org)). I'd have loved to compare results for the rest of the world too, but I guess there aren't as many IKEAs there

> **Children overwhelmingly prefer playing with their friends and parents over watching TV.**  
>  When children across the world were asked to choose between watching TV or playing with friends or parents, they overwhelmingly choose to play with friends (89%) and parents (73%) with TV a very poor substitute for social interaction at only 11%. **Nearly half of the parents think play should be educational. Children disagree.**  
>  Nearly half (45%) of all parents think that play is best when it’s educational. This rises to two thirds of parents in China, Slovakia, Czech Rep, Spain, Hungary, Russia, Poland and Portugal. A further minority at 17% (China, Italy, Russia and US) actually prefer their children to learn things rather than to simply play. 27% think play should always have a purpose. As for the children, 51% actually prefer to play rather than learn
