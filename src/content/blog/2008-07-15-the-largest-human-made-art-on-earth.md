  A giant's brief trace,  
  Erased by nature's embrace,  
  Echoes in the sand.

Ephemeral, large-scale art by artist Jim Denevan

> Take the huge dry lake bed. Choose a stick. Make the largest sand drawing on Earth
>
> Next on the list could be - aliens see it, make contact. Well, even without aliens, this art is more than mind-boggling in its scale. It's planet-altering
> Jim Denevan made the world's largest freehand drawing a few weeks ago on a dry lake in Nevada. How big is it? Three mile across, which took 100 miles of walking to draw the pattern
> [. . .]
> Even though esthetically it's a welcome addition to the landscape, it is also a sort of a transient mark - like a cloud, or a river-bed. Immense in its scope, and lasting only a moment in the large scale of things
> We asked the artist, how long did this stupendous artwork last?
> "Completely erased in a rainstorm the next week… It felt strange to work so hard and not see tide come in. But rains did come which is sort of the same thing
