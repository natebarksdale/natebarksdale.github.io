  Apologies flow,  
  For moments lost in silence,  
  Time's weight never wanes.

> My apologies to time for all the world I overlook each second.
> My apologies to past loves for thinking that the latest is the first.
> Forgive me, distant wars, for bringing flowers home.
> Forgive me, open wounds, for pricking my finger.
> I apologize for my record of minuets to those who cry from the depths.
> I apologize to those who wait in railway stations for being asleep today at five a.m.  
> —Wislawa Szymborska, trans. by Stanislaw Baranczak and Clare Cavanaugh, "[Under One Small Star](http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/under-one-small-star/)" (excerpt)
