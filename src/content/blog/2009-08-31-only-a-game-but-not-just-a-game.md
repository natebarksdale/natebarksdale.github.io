  Days stretch like sorrow,  
  Drawn battles play out in time,  
  Life’s rich game unfolds.

The highest form of cricket, the test match, can take five days to play and can still end in a draw. This maddens many a baseball-raised, extra-innings-till-it's-over outsider, but nonetheless, this columnist argues, it's a very good, and very human thing

> I don't mean to be _too_ flippant here, nor to accord cricket _too_ great an importance in the great kerfuffle of life—I simply say that the reason that test match cricket exerts such a tremendous fascination is that is shares so many qualities with the greater, more terrible dramas that make up the human experience.It does so in a condensed, peaceful form and triumph and failure on the cricket field are ultimately trivial but the game moves us just as great art moves us. To pretend otherwise is, it strikes me, silly. That is, sure it's _only_ a game but it's also not just a game.In other words, it is _life_. And like war, and life, that sometimes end in stalemate. Which means a draw. There are winning draws and losing draws and plain old dull draws. But without them, or the possibility of them, everything else is too neat, too simple and, in the end, too unsatisfactory
