  Strings bring pain and strain,  
  Heroes play their plastic chords,  
  Real rhythm remains.

> **Music |** “The success of Guitar Hero means that the onus is now on the manufacturers of ‘real’ guitars to make them easier,” a blogger [says](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/jan/06/popandrock). “Why are they still making guitars with ‘real’ strings that are difficult and boring to learn how to play and really make your fingers hurt? What is the point?” Are musicians to be protected like some sort of medieval guild? [[Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/jan/06/popandrock)]
