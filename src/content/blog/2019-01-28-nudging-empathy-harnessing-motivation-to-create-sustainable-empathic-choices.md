  Empathy's decline,  
  Nurtured hearts renew the bond,  
  Hope in each effort.

For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about the innovative efforts to grow our capacity for empathy.

> For an academic psychologist, surveying the state of the study of empathy can be a depressing business. There was the 2011 meta-analysis by the University of Michigan’s Sara Konrath that suggested that today’s college students report themselves to be [much less empathetic](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/eob/edobrien_empathyPSPR.pdf) than did their predecessors a generation or two before. Numerous studies examine how people experience “compassion fatigue” in the face of mass suffering, choosing self-protective apathy over engaging with the suffering of others. In 2016, Yale psychologist Paul Bloom published [Against Empathy](https://www.amazon.com/Against-Empathy-Case-Rational-Compassion/dp/0062339346/ref=sr_1_1?gclid=CjwKCAiAlO7uBRANEiwA_vXQ-2Ekn3lZnDOVRcVC4IDT1uyM2ZtDonXVxPgfxlx6Wb6lFvsu3AtD0hoCX4kQAvD_BwE&hvadid=241620454055&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9007535&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=b&hvrand=18358739722738287468&hvtargid=kwd-113555416846&hydadcr=22534_10353872&keywords=against+empathy&qid=1574719622&sr=8-1)_,_ suggesting that since empathy is a biased emotion, it is at best unreliable and at worst downright harmful because it steers us towards caring most about those in our in-groups. If empathy is indeed a fixed or even declining resource, it might make sense to disregard it entirely.

> C. Daryl Cameron, an assistant professor of psychology at Penn State, is part of a group of researchers who argue that there’s still a good case to be made both for valuing empathy and for seeing it as a renewable resource — something that, with the right kind of motivated effort, can even increase. Cameron is currently leading a three-year project designed to test whether simple experimental manipulations can change people’s levels of empathy. The goal is to move towards a proven set of interventions to help people develop greater skill and capacity for empathy.
