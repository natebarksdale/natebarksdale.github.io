  A nave like a ship,  
  Capturing complex stories,  
  Faith sails through the night.

As with many of LaChapelle's lavish staged photographic tableaux, this invites multiple (and probably contradictory, not to mention uncomfortable) readings. But I do like this piece: I'm always attracted to the imagery of churches as ships—every catherdal, after all, has its nave
