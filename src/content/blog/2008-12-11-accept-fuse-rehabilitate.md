  From afar we bring,  
  Vital fire to the gross,  
  Accept, fuse, and lead.

After all not to create only,  
 or found only,  
But to bring perhaps from afar  
what is already founded,  
To give it our own identity,  
average, limitless, free,  
To fill the gross the torpid bulk  
with vital religious fire,  
Not to repel or destroy so much as accept,  
fuse, rehabilitate,  
To obey as well as command,  
to follow more than to lead . . .
