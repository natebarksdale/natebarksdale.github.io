  Colorful layers blend,  
  Uplifting forms come alive,  
  Beauty in chaos.

Southern California artist Jay Kelly's collages are arresting and uplifting, messy and beautiful, painterly and graphic designer-ish—and just the slightest bit repetitive (looking at a whole year's work on one of his [gallery pages](http://web.archive.org/web/20090619042258/http://www.jkfineart.com:80/gallery2008.html) feels a bit like perusing the motivational artwork at the offices of the world's coolest corporation). But one or two at a time, they're really something. [![image](http://culture-making.com/media/2008-Remember-pop.jpg)](http://www.jkfineart.com/)
