> The History Channel has launched a major update to the app I help oversee content for, History HERE. In addition to a nicely executed visual update, version 3.0 of the app also features a new Tours feature, with topical itineraries. For the 3.0 launch I wrote seven of the 14 tours available. The tour is a fun way to dig into the history of a place through the lens of a specific topic. [Download the app](http://www.history.com/interactives/history-here) for free on iOS and Android to view the tours I wrote:

> - Lincoln's Assassination
> - New York City Culinary
> - History of the Detroit Auto Industry
> - Los Angeles Culinary
> - Nashville Music History
> - Mississippi Civil Rights
