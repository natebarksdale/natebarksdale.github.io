  Amália sings with soul,  
  Longing on the soft night breeze,  
  Hearts intertwined, lost.

A lovely performance from the late diva of the [fado](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fado), a longing-infused Portuguese song-style. I'm particularly taken with the almost warbling high flourishes, which call to mind flamenco singing and, behind it all, deep roots in Arabic music
"[Gaivota](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhagDjqN_ww&feature=related)," live TV performance by Amália Rodrigues
