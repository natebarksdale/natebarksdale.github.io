Calligraphy on horseback! Now that would take some serious skill and practice. There's a modern [Fujimori Festival](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&u=http://www.fujinomorijinjya.or.jp/&ei=Ge6_Sa69CJqqtQPG9pmbBA&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=2&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3D%25E8%2597%25A4%25E6%25A3%25AE%25E7%25A5%25AD%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3DpTe) at the eponymous shrine, though I dare not lean too hard on auto-translation to proclaim a direct linkage. Still, "[Shrine of the horses and learning](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&u=http://www.fujinomorijinjya.or.jp/&ei=Ge6_Sa69CJqqtQPG9pmbBA&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=2&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3D%25E8%2597%25A4%25E6%25A3%25AE%25E7%25A5%25AD%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3DpTe)" sounds about right.
