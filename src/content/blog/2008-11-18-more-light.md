  In the shadow's grip,

Here's a synthesis of an email/chat exchange I had with a friend over the weekend

>
> **E:** The beginning of daylight savings and the realization that it won’t be lighter than it is now until sometime in February has me looking for “light in the darkness.” I saw this auto store last night, and liked it
> **N:** Did you know that Goethe’s last words were “More light!”?
> **E:** Oh, how wonderful! The only Goethe quote I know is “everything is a leaf”
> **N:** The really funny part is, you see it quoted like that, but I looked it up and evidently his final sentence was “Could you open up the shade in the window so as to let in more light?”
> **E:** That’s so much better! Less mystical, and therefore more so
> …
> **Coda:** Of course now I had to look it all up again. Goethe’s last words, like those of many a famous person, are contested. The top alternate contendor is, “Come, my little daughter, and give me your little paw.” The original German version of More Light is, ”[Macht doch den zweiten Fensterladen in der Stube auch auf, damit mehr Licht hereinkomme.](http://books.google.com/books?id=MC4TAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA677&dq=goethe+%22mehr+licht%22+zweiten&lr=&as_brr=1&ei=gxMjSfWBNZLakASZx_yZDg)” Pesky German habit of ending the sentence with a verb! Well, “Come in here!” has its own mystical charm too
