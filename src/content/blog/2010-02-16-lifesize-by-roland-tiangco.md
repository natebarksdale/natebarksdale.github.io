Here's something pleasing from a young Brooklyn artist: "Book # 001 of a series of books which contain 100% printed reproductions of everything in our world." With a big nod in the direction of Jorge Luis Borges, who imagined an ancient empire where the craft of cartography had become so exact that the entire realm was mapped on a 1:1 scale, which of course [covered the entire realm](http://web.archive.org/web/20241114011123/https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/bu/people/bs/borges.html). "In the western Deserts, tattered Fragments of the Map are still to be found, Sheltering an occasional Beast or beggar; in the whole Nation, no other relic is left of the Discipline of Geography." Tiangco's first 1:1 reproduction is of an anthropology bookshelf; the whole thing is printed single-sided and perforated, so you can cut up the book and make a giant, bookshelf-sized poster out of it. Hey, it's probably cheaper than [Books by the Foot](http://www.strandbooks.com/app/www/p/bbtfoot/).
