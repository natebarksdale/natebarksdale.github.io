#### Wimbo Zuri Catalog No. 049.1A09-1

From the [**50 States!**](https://www.natebarksdale.com/?tag=states) series of CDs, created after the subjects of [Connexcellent!]() mix moved south to the national Capital. The background pattern for the cover is probably the least visually striking of the series, but it is a faithful reproduction of the striped upholstered armchairs in the Bush/early Obama-era Oval Office.
