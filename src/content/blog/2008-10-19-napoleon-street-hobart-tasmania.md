description: A charming observation on the interplay of angles and the picturesque harbor in Hobart, Tasmania. "I love the interplay of angles in this home—the gables and the steep-sloped street. And once you get out into the harbor, it's more or less a straight shot south to Antarctica."

  Gables touch the sky,  
  Steep streets lead to the sea's edge,  
  Southward dreams will sail.
