#### Wimbo Zuri Catalog No. 048.1A09-1

The challenge I gave myself for this one: reference as many Alfred Hitchcock film titles as possible without having the music slide entirely into a stew of murder and terror and deep discomfort. For the most part it worked out. I'm still not satisfied with the visual side of the design‚Äîan uneasy riffing on Saul Bass's title credits for _Vertigo_ and _North by Northwest_ , but I did enjoy working the director's famous profile into the Wimbo Zuri icon.
