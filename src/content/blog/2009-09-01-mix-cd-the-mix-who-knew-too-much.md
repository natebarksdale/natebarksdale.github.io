#### Wimbo Zuri Catalog No. 048.1A09-1

The challenge I gave myself for this one: reference as many Alfred Hitchcock film titles as possible without having the music slide entirely into a stew of murder and terror and deep discomfort. For the most part it worked out. I'm still not satisfied with the visual side of the designâ€”an uneasy riffing on Saul Bass's title credits for _Vertigo_ and _North by Northwest_ , but I did enjoy working the director's famous profile into the Wimbo Zuri icon.
