Rugby fan that I am, I find it odd to think of American football teams performing their own versions of the Polynesian pregame _[haka](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83U_Vg1GRvA)_ (here in Oregon I think it was brought over by Hawaiian football recruits). Still, it's a step in the right direction—now they just need to ditch the pads, helmets, and forward passes

> [The high school football team in Euless, TX (population 52,900) starts their games by performing the haka](http://web.archive.org/web/20200815022405/http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2008/10/04/cultural-appropriation-of-the-kick-ass-kind/), a chanting dance used to [intimidating effect](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtDOwbahKjE) by New Zealand's All Blacks rugby team. What's odd/interesting about this is that the Maori chant was appropriated by the team's contingent of Tongan players--whose parents moved to the town to work at DFW airport--and has led to a greater sense of acceptance of the Tongans into the larger community. How's that for multiculturalism?
