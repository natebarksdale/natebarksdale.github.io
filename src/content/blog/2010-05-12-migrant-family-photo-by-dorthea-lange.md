This is one of Dorthea Lange's FSA photos that I hadn't seen before. I like the aesthetics (the cris-crossing musical-instrument vectors; the look of concentration on the mandolin-kid's face), but more than that I appreciate its depiction of "dust bowl refugees" not just as weather-beaten victims, but as culture makers (and -keepers) in their own right. The photo is part of the recently-published paperback anthology [_Hard Luck Blues: Roots Music Photographs from the Great Depression_](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22_Hard%20Luck%20Blues%3A%20Roots%20Music%20Photographs%20from%20the%20Great%20Depression_%22%20amazon.com).
