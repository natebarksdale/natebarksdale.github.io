  Moral stains we feel,  
  Cleansed by water and soap's touch,  
  Sins washed, guilt remains.

From an interview with Chen-Bo Zhong, who researches the link between abstract concepts and physical feelings‚Äîthe deep cultural power of metaphor

> **LEHRER:** What are some other examples of how seemingly abstract thoughts, such as feeling excluded, can have physical manifestations?
>
> **ZHONG:** Another example would be the relation between morality and physical cleanliness. In my early work ‚Äú[Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing](http://web.archive.org/web/20100107150306/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/313/5792/1451)‚Äù in collaboration with Katie Liljenquist [a professor of organizational behavior at Brigham Young University], we discussed how metaphors such as ‚Äú _dirty hands_ ‚Äù or ‚Äú _clean records_ ‚Äù may have a psychological basis such that people make sense of morality through [physical cleanliness](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=washing-hands-reduces-mor)
>
> When people‚Äôs [moral](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=thinking-about-morality) self image is threatened, as when they think about their own unethical past behaviors, people literally experience the need to engage in physical cleansing, as if the moral stain is literally physical dirt. We tested this idea in multiple studies and showed that when reminded of their past moral transgressions, people were more likely to think about cleansing-related words such as _‚Äúwash‚Äù_ and _‚Äúsoap‚Äù_ , expressed stronger preference for cleansing products (for instance, a soap bar), and were also more likely to accept an antiseptic wipe as a free gift (rather than a pencil with equal value)

> Further, physical cleansing may actually be effective in mentally getting rid of moral sins. In another study, in which participants who recalled unethical behaviors were either given a chance to cleanse their hands or not, we found that washing hands not only assuaged moral emotions such as guilt and regret but also reduced participants‚Äô willingness to engage in [prosocial behaviors](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22prosocial%20behaviors%22%20sciam.com) such as [volunteering](http://web.archive.org/web/20100107150306/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/313/5792/1451) Thus physical washing can actually wash away sins. Perhaps this effect is why most world religions practice some form of washing rituals to purify souls. We should be cautious, however, knowing that if our sins are so easily ‚Äúwashed away‚Äù we might not be as motivated to engage in actual compensatory behaviors to make up for our mistakes
