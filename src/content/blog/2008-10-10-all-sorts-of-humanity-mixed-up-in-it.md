Applied bioethics finds a new home in prime time

> I watch [_Grey’s Anatomy_](http://web.archive.org/web/20250114065603/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573/) for the fast-paced gore and the overblown personal dramas. I watch its spin-off, [_Private Practice_](http://web.archive.org/web/20241219103450/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0972412/), for all that along with its thoughtful treatment of bioethical dramas – the same dramas we’re seeing in real-life hospitals and public debate

> The bioethics debate isn’t just a clinical and scientific debate or an abstract and philosophical one. It’s a debate about how to best fulfill the human longings for long life, good life, health and family. There’s all sorts of humanity mixed up in it - competing human longings and fallible human judgment deciding human life’s creation and existence. While philosophers and politicians squabble, doctors practice bioethics every day; and they don’t always have the time for debate when human life is at stake and the ethical choice isn’t clear
