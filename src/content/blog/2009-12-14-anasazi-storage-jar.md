  Ancient hands at work,  
  Patterns dance on clay's surface,  
  Time whispers through art.

A beautiful artifact of the ancient [Anasazi Pueblo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anasazi) civilization, which flourished in what is now Arizona and New Mexico. I love the vibrancy and detail with which this is painted—would that my current storage vessels revealed such individual craft and care.
