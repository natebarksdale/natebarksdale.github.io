  Virtual smokes crushed,  
  Waving goodbye to the haze,  
  Freedom in the grasp.

A fascinating study that gets at at the power of gestures, postures, and practice, even when it's only at the level of visualization. I want to see a follow-up study as to the effects of crushing real vs. virtual smokes

> Smokers who crushed computer-simulated cigarettes as part of a psychosocial treatment program in a virtual reality environment had significantly reduced nicotine dependence and higher rates of tobacco abstinence than smokers participating in the same program who grasped a computer-simulated ball, according to a study described in the current issue of _[CyberPsychology and Behavior](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22CyberPsychology%20and%20Behavior%22%20liebertonline.com)._
