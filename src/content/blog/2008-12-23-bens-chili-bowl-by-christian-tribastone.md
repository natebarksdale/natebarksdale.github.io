I actually had a [photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dracisk/265636236/in/pool-495413@N25) of this [famous D.C. eatery](http://web.archive.org/web/20090122045633/http://benschilibowl.com:80/history.html), located on the U Street corridor then known as "Black Broadway," all queued up for eventual posting, but this charming painting/sketch showed up and trumped it
