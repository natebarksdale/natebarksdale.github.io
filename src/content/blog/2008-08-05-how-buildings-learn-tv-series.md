  Structures evolve slow,  
  Timeless beams tell tales of wood,  
  Learning through the years.

Haven't watched the videos yet, but I can vouch for the book, which Andy references enthusiasticly in Chapter 3 of _Culture Making_

> In 1997, the BBC aired a three-hour documentary based on Stewart Brand’s book, [How Buildings Learn](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22How%20Buildings%20Learn%22%20amazon.com). Brand has posted the whole program on Google Video in six 30-minute parts: [part one](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22part%20one%22%20video.google.com), [part two](http://web.archive.org/web/20120525044049/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5088653796598486022), [part three](http://web.archive.org/web/20120525043857/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6141960341438553915), [part four](http://web.archive.org/web/20120525043700/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8761299882173964035), [part five](http://web.archive.org/web/20120525044339/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5407846553590755822), [part six](http://web.archive.org/web/20120525044915/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2283224496826631552)

> If you’re hesitant about whether to watch the series or not, check out this two-minute appetizer of perhaps the meatiest tidbit in the book: [the oak beam replacement plan for the dining hall of New College, Oxford](http://web.archive.org/web/20111012200028/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=405814293755343270).

> **Update:** [An old version of the New College web site](http://web.archive.org/web/20020816065622/http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/NC/Trivia/Oaks/) says that the oaks were not planted specifically for the replacement of the ceiling beams even though they were used for that purpose.
