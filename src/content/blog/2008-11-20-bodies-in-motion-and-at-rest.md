OK, so I stole this post's title from Galileo via Thomas Lynch's lovely (though off-topic) [book](http://web.archive.org/web/20241225054920/https://www.amazon.com/Bodies-Motion-Rest-Metaphor-Mortality/dp/0393321649/). Let's resume the thread with the artist's own statement: "Subway drawings have become a big part of my sketching life, I used to read on my commute to the city but if you've read one Grisham you've read 'em all. I live out in Crown Heights, Brooklyn and take the [5 train](https://www.google.com/search?q=%225%20train%22%20mta.info) into the city, as any commuter will tell you, you see the same people time and time again
