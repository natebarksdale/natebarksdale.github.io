I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4BawWTweE6jf9HFq97MXIc?si=d0XsNBpUTDaZMNtwm0H90w) for The History Channel. I spent a surprising amount of time looking through Army field manuals to track down the distinctive markings of a particular French-made howitzer.

> January 15, 1939. It's finally working! After countless mechanical issues, the first operational ski lift in the state of Utah is taking people up the mountain so they can glide down its slopes. Skiing conditions are ideal in the town of Alta, and this lift will allow this relatively new sport to explode in popularity. But as beautiful as Alta is, there's also a looming threat... avalanches.

> Alta is in one of the most avalanche-prone areas in the entire country. It used to be a small mining town, and its residents have been dealing with avalanches for years, mourning their dead and rebuilding again and again. But now, with Alta becoming a haven for skiing, drastic measures will be needed to keep thousands of visitors safe.
