I think part of the reason why I like making mix CDs is that it's so much like working on a magazine, something I did for a few years in the early 2000s as editor of _re:generation quarterly_. Coming up with a cover theme, soliciting and ordering a group of articles, sweating the details of a table of contents or the running headers, making sure all the commas are italicized correctly. During my time at RQ, my editor-in-chief and co-conspirator was Andy Crouch (who I've worked with again much more recently on the [**Culture Making**](http://web.archive.org/web/20240326204250/http://www.culture-making.com/) website). After RQ folded, as a parting gift for Andy I put together this mix, styled along the lines of the last-gasp redesign that only lasted one issue. If you can truly sum up the work we did—and the structure of the magazine— in 45min worth of music, I think this at least comes close. And for outsiders, I suspect it's still a good listen.
