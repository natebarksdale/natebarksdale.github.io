I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/00QU1JRrAOemW7W1TdOAdW?si=ciF7RuXGSsaKMsRbU8Uolg) for The History Channel.

> February 26, 1924. 10 Defendants enter a courtroom in Munich. They are being charged with an attempted coup. They tried to overthrow the government of the Weimar Republic…and almost succeeded. All eyes are on the second defendant to enter the room. When the judge reads this man’s name into the record, he identifies him as a Munich writer named Adolf Hitler. Today: Hitler’s first attempt to seize power. How did his 1923 coup fail? And why would Hitler later say that this failure was “perhaps the greatest good fortune of my life?”
