  Streets intertwine worlds,

Google Maps launched Street View coverage for Australia and Japan today. Let the cross-cultural-exploration begin! (I should note that it took a good 20min of clicking around Tokyo's streets before I found some funny English to link to. Nearly all the words I came upon were, contrary to stereotype, quite correct.)
