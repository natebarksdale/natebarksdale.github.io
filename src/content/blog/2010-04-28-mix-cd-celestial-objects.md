#### Wimbo Zuri Catalog No. 055.1A10-1

A custom mix commissioned for the birthday of a fellow historian of science and longtime astronomy buff. The 19 tracks correspond to the 19 brightest visible objects in the sky, from the sun through the moon and satellites down to some of the brighter stars. I designed the CD case so it doubled as a star finder, with a celestial wheel printed onto the disc itself, and a horizon cutout in the front cover.
