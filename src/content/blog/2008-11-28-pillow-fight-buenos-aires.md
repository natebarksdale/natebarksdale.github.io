From the photographer's caption: "Yesterday a couple thousand teenagers gathered in front of the Planetarium in Parque Palermo for a facebook-organized, flash mob pillow fight [_lucha de almohadas_]. Beatrice has a [great set over at flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/blmurch/sets/72157594383153555/) and you should also check out [this video from YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MUgHhYU1nY), it's from the pillow fight from 2006 but you get a sense of what it's like to be in the middle of it. The event also has its own official blog, [Lucha de Almohadas](http://www.luchadealmohadas.blogspot.com/)
