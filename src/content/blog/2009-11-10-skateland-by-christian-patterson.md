I love the cheery desolation in this photo. And, of course, the wings on the roller boot (or maybe it's the wheels on the winged boot). I always wondered how Mercury would come in for a smooth landing. [![photo](http://culture-making.com/media/sound_affects_003.jpg)](http://christianpatterson.com/)
