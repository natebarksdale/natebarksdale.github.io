I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5fFDsKYYG9AX6ZuQ5GzY0b?si=u3VRvGsJTmKVNV4HFrotUA) for The History Channel.

> August 1, 1936. The opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. Adolf Hitler enters the stadium to a militaristic Wagner march. Swastikas flutter everywhere on the flag of the Nazi Party. When these moments are remembered later, one athlete’s name comes up more than any other: Jesse Owens. He’s a Black American sprinter, a legendary athlete, and one of 18 Black Americans who competed in Hitler’s Olympics. How, through these 1936 Games, does this one man become mythologized? And what is the forgotten context of his storied Olympic wins?
