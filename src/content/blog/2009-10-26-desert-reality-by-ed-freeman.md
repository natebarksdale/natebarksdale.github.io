  Desert dreams linger,  
  Abandoned blooms entwined,  
  Silent stories grow.

I love LA-based photographer Ed Freeman's Desert Reality series, lovingly dead-on portraits of depopulated or abandoned buildings. There's a corresponding Urban Reality series as well, though there the lack of people is more unsettling. (Interestingly, Freeman's previous music career included a gig as producer of Don McLean's rock and roll ur-song "American Pie"). I particularly love the simultaneous warmth and foreboding in this picture, the way the overgrown tree in bloom is embracing the tiny house. We work to cultivate our gardens, but when we can work no more, our gardens return the favor.
