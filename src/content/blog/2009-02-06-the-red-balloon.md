  A balloon so red,  
  Floating through urban dreams,  
  Silence speaks volumes.

I watched this legendary short film a few months ago—I thought I'd seen it before, but evidently just felt like I had via references in [The Simpsons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crepes_of_Wrath), [German 80s pop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQYQTFudrqc), and the forthcoming Pixar film [Up](http://web.archive.org/web/20120610235633/http://www.pixar.com:80/featurefilms/up/), which in some ways begins with The Red Balloon's (to my mind mildly disturbing) closing scene. Fun fact: TRB is the only dialogue-free film to have won the Oscar for best original screenplay
