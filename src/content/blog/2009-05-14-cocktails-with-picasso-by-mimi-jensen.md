This is actually not my favorite San Francisco painter Mimi Jenson's still lifes, though it's still quite good. But what stopped me short is that I have that exact cut-rate Picasso etching on my wall, and for that matter a Montecristo cigar box full of old maps on my bookshelf. So nice to encounter old friends in surprising settings. [![image](http://culture-making.com/media/cocktails_with_picasso.jpg)](http://www.mimijensen.com/pages/cocktails_with_picasso.phtml)
