  Schematic and sleek,  
  Traces of life intertwined,  
  Art from the palm's heart.

I love how this careful schematic cross-section of a palm stem calls to mind, of all things, [Indian/First Nations art](http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um=1&q=haida+art&ie=UTF-8&ei=6zWYSp-3GoHssQPi5PH_AQ&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1) from the Pacific Northwest‚Äîabout as un-palmy a place as you can go to. [About the palm](http://www.rarepalmseeds.com/pix/EugTri.shtml): "Large, ascending leaves to about 6 m (20 ft.) tall, with glossy green leaflets, spiny leafstalks and a mostly underground, clustering trunk characterize this unusual palm from the Malay Peninsula. It is found in disturbed, open areas in rainforests between sea level and 800 m (2700 ft.). The large, scaly fruit are edible when unripe and the leaves make excellent thatch. [About the man](http://sciweb.nybg.org/Science2/Onlinexhibits/exhbtcata.html): "The author of over 150 botanical titles, including the great flora of Brazil, Karl Friedrich Philipp von Martius also wrote the still-definitive three-volume treatise on the palm family, one of the first plant monographs. He developed his life-long fascination with palms during an expedition through Brazil from 1817 to 1820, and he worked nearly 30 years to prepare this grand summation, including palms found only as fossils."
