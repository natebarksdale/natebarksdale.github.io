For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about 2020 Templeton Prize ceremony.

The people on stage wore cloth face coverings and there were disclaimers — “all crew members were tested, masked and required to maintain social distancing” — at the beginning of the video segments. For honoree Dr. Francis Collins, the former leader of the Human Genome Project and current director of the National Institutes of Health, the safety measures were both a necessary precaution and an appropriate symbol of the extraordinary role he has been called on to play in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.

While Collins’ _past_ achievements — in genetics, healthcare, and fostering dialogue between religious and scientific perspectives — stand on their own, Collins’ _present_ role leading one of the the United States’ medical research agencies during a global pandemic may wind up being his life’s most important work, as the NIH marshalls its resources to aid development of vaccines and treatments for the novel coronavirus, with millions of lives potentially in the balance.
