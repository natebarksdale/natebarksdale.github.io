Time lost is time in which we have failed to live a full human life, gain
experience, learn, create, enjoy, and suffer; it is time that has not been
filled up, but left empty. These last years have certainly not been like that.
Our losses have been great and immeasurable, but time has not been lost.

Years](http://books.google.com/books?id=q7pyQwhiUcQC&pg=PA256&dq=%22time+lost%22+bonhoeffer&ei=H2yPSPGfApzOswPFh5GzAg&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U3f2oKmM5CxW1-n67W4-4qZJJ00jA#PPA256,M1),"
