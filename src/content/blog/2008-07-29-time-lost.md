  Time, not lost nor vain,  
  In joy and pain, we have grown,  
  Life’s full measure found.

> Time lost is time in which we have failed to live a full human life, gain experience, learn, create, enjoy, and suffer; it is time that has not been filled up, but left empty. These last years have certainly not been like that. Our losses have been great and immeasurable, but time has not been lost.
