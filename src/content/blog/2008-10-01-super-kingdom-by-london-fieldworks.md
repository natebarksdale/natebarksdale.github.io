  Nature's shelter built,  
  Towering dreams in the trees,  
  Life's fragile refuge.

From a series of site-specific "show homes" inspired by the hibernation patterns of local animals. "Amazing birdhouses" doesn't quite seem to capture it all, but I think it might be roughly accurate. For me the symbolic resonances that jumped out from this particular image were: the Tower of Babel and Noah's Ark—or, come to think of it—a cross between the Garden of Eden and the New Jerusalem
