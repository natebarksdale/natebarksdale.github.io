  From charts they rise,

  Melodies of time.

Use the map controls to zoom on this extremely tall timeline; the creators took the [Billboard Top 5](http://waxy.org/2008/05/the_whitburn_project/) charts from every year since 1890, found the full lyrics, and extracted all the first names. For the most part, the names that show up have little to do with the [popular baby names](http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/) of a given year. I'm a little surprised how few of the songs I could name from the names: a couple from the 80s and 90s, and several more from the Beatles years, but that's about it
