  Pages full of dreams,  
  Stories whirl like hurricanes,  
  Timeless, wild, profound.

A bit of why one of my favorite books is, well, one of my favorite books

> As things stand, though, it‚Äôs not easy to see anything beating the far more famous Indian novel on the list - which might be more of an injustice if _Midnight‚Äôs Children_ (1981) by Salman Rushdie weren‚Äôt also the best book of the lot. Nearly 30 years - and at least three more classic Rushdies - later, Midnight‚Äôs Children should, in theory, have lost its power to astonish. In practice, rereading it instantly returned me to that original state of awed disbelief that so much exhilarating stuff can be packed into a single novel. (Rushdie, you feel, could have knocked off the entire plot of Oscar and Lucinda in one chapter here.) At times, the unstoppable commitment to storytelling seems almost pathological. Yet, in the end, the book is so thrilling that wishing Rushdie had trimmed it into something less wild would be as futile as asking a hurricane to tone it down a bit.
