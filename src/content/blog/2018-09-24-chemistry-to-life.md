For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about the origins of life and the chemical conundrums that puzzle today's scientists.

> When today’s chemists and geologists attempt to understand the conditions under which the first life emerged on earth around four billion years ago, they tend to focus on RNA, which is the most basic family of molecules capable of two requirements for life: metabolism and reproduction. But in explaining how the first RNA might have been formed, they run up against a handful of seemingly intractable paradoxes.
