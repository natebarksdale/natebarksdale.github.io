  Melodies that soar,

This is one of my favorite Indian film songs, bar none, from the 1991 Malayalam film [Bharatham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatham). The plot and the music delve richly into the [carnatic music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music) heritage of South India, notable for its wide and precise vocal quavers and deep, soulful rhythmicality. Like most Indian film music, there are occasional moments of (to my ears) cheesiness, but these only make it all the more thrilling when the groove kicks in at 1:27
