I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0m4DRATcVH4e3KVkJIJcEE?si=8WtpmZz6SUWyj62So2diWw) for The History Channel.

> June 17, 1972. In the early morning hours, five men are caught after breaking into the Watergate building in Washington, DC. The failed break-in that night will eventually lead to the unraveling of a major American scandal that reaches the highest levels of government. Why did President Nixon and the men around him believe that they could get away with something so obviously illegal? And how - for one of our producers - did this episode hit close to home?
