  In nanotech's wake,  
  Views divide like night and day,  
  Values shape our fears.

The same issue of Nature Nanotechnology has two additional articles about public perceptions of the field's promises and pitfalls, including one that [correlates religious belief with skepticism](http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nnano.2008.361.html) about all things nano—because, [reports the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7767192.stm), of its "potential to create life at a nano scale without divine intervention." Which better fits the typical science-journalism narrative than peopling being skeptical because they're worried about, say, economic inequality or justice issues

> Rather than infer that nanotechnology is safe, members of the public who learn about this novel science tend to become sharply polarized along cultural lines, according to a study conducted by the Cultural Cognition Project at Yale Law School in collaboration with the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies. The report is published online in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.These findings have important implications for garnering support of the new technology, say the researchers.The experiment involved a diverse sample of 1,500 Americans, the vast majority of whom were unfamiliar with nanotechnology, a relatively new science that involves the manipulation of particles the size of atoms and that has numerous commercial applications. When shown balanced information about the risks and benefits of nanotechnology, study participants became highly divided on its safety compared to a group not shown such information.The determining factor in how people responded was their cultural values, according to Dan Kahan, the Elizabeth K. Dollard Professor at Yale Law School and lead author of the study. "People who had more individualistic, pro-commerce values, tended to infer that nanotechnology is safe," said Kahan, "while people who are more worried about economic inequality read the same information as implying that nanotechnology is likely to be dangerous."According to Kahan, this pattern is consistent with studies examining how people's cultural values influence their perceptions of environmental and technological risks generally. "In sum, when they learned about a new technology, people formed reactions to it that matched their views of risks like climate change and nuclear waste disposal," he said
