description: This passage raises intriguing points about safety and control in theme parks, highlighting their structured environments. "Unlike the Garden, the theme park is not a place where you can get hurt—or if you do, it’s not your fault, and you can sue. And to keep you from getting hurt, in the theme park, you are never alone. Not only are you accompanied by throngs of other park guests, but by omnipresent representatives of the theme park corporation, there to ensure and (if necessary) enforce enjoyment of the theme park on the owners’ terms."

  Throngs of laughter rise,  
  Under watchful eyes we play,  
  Joy stitched by the ties.
