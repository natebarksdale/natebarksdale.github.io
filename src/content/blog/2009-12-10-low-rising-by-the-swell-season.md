  Joy and sorrow dance,  
  In melancholic tunes,  
  Hearts are weathered skies.

Glen Hansard and Mark√©ta Irglov√°, The Guy and The Girl from the wonderful movie [Once](http://www.amazon.com/Once-Glen-Hansard/dp/B000X1Z0BU/cmcom-20), have a new album out as The Swell Season, gloriously titled Strict Joy. This video, from the first single, was directed by Sam Beam, a former professor of cinematography better known for his own musical career as [Iron & Wine](http://www.ironandwine.com/). I love its gentle good humor about the running together of joy and sadness, solitude and partnership, our personal storms and the weather outside
