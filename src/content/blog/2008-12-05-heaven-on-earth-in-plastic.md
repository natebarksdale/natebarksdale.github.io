Finder's comment: "I found this while closing shop at the cafe where I work. I think a girl, who was practicing what she learned at massage school, dropped it." _Culture Making_ gloss: "Culture, then, is the furniture of heaven. (And indeed, Revelation makes it clear, in the words of Belinda Carlisle, that 'heaven is a place on earth.') It is simply not true, according to Isaiah and John—and according to the whole sweep of the biblical story from beginning to end—that “souls” are the only eternal things, or that human beings are all that last into eternity."
