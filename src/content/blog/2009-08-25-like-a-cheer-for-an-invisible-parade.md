  Tail raised to the sky,  
  Melancholy cheers resound,  
  Invisible march.

> Frequently the [peacock] combines the lifting of his tail with the raising of his voice. He appears to receive through his feet some shock from the center of the earth, which travels upward through him and is released: _Eee-ooo-ii! Eee-ooo-ii!_ To the melancholy this sound is melancholy and to the hysterical it is hysterical. To me it has always sound like a cheer for an invisible parade.
