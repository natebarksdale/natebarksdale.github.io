description: The intricacies of Cuzco's mortarless Incan masonry never cease to amaze me, especially regarding how the seams between the blocks appear on the inside. How complex might the joints be? The geolocation coordinates for this remarkable structure are approximately -13.5226, -71.9731.

  Stones fit like puzzle,  
  Secrets hide within the seams,  
  Time stands still in stone.

I'm familiar (but none the less amazed) with the look of Cuzco's famous mortarless Incan masonry (talk about a well-disciplined cultural offering!), the seams between the blocks at once organic and artificial. But whenever I see another image like this, I wonder what the seams look like on the inside—do the joints just go straight back? Do things get even more complex?
