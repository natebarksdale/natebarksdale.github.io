  Words lost in the void,  
  Sounds of distant strangers speak,  
  Worlds apart we share.

A lovely (if hardly comprehensive) graph inspired by a question from Language Log reader Yuval Pinter: "When an English speaker doesn't understand a word one says, it's 'Greek to me.' When a Hebrew speaker encounters this difficulty, it 'sounds like Chinese.' I've been told the Korean equivalent is 'sounds like Hebrew.'"
