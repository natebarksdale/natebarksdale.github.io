Ah, the life-changing power of the right book at the right time. The reissue of [An African in Greenland](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22An%20African%20in%20Greenland%22%20amazon.com) moves right to the top of my travel writing to-read list. a [Futility Closet](<http://www.futilitycloset.com/2010/03/15/northern-exposure/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+FutilityCloset+(Futility+Closet)&utm_content=Google+Reader>) post by Greg Ross, 15 March 2010

When I was standing before them on the wharf, they all raised their heads to look me full in the face. Some children clung to their mothers’ coats, and others began to scream with fright or to weep.
> > Kpomassie happily spent the next two years driving a dogsled and hunting seal in a kayak. After eight years, he had reached the land of his dreams — a country with no trees and no snakes
