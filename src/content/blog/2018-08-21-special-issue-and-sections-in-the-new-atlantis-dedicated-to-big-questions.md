For the John Templeton Foundation, I wrote about the profound inquiries into science and ethics featured in _The New Atlantis._

> Are we alone in the cosmos, and if so, how should we think of ourselves? What do the insights of evolutionary theory mean for ethics?

In a world dominated by Twitter conversations, addressing big questions in ways that require more than 280 characters is difficult. Tackling them requires careful, deliberate reflection, multiple vantage points, and an approach that aims to be both of-the-moment and timeless.
