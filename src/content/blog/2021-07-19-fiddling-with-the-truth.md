I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4wYaAQ6jTXsGOs3yUDFqUs?si=Z5Mc-j_yQleFti6p9HlUiw) for The History Channel.

> July 19, 64 AD. The Circus Maximus is the main arena in ancient Rome at this time, where tens of thousands watch chariot races and gladiator fights. The stadium is surrounded by shops and bars and restaurants, the whole area teeming with life. And tonight, it will all be destroyed. Nero, the emperor of Rome, will allegedly fiddle while he watches his city burn, and may have even set the fire himself.
