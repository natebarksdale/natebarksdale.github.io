OK, so it's not exactly what Peter Berger had in mind when he said "All human society is an enterprise of world-building," but could I resist the charms of this video of the inside of a cardboard-globe factory? I could not. (A video about the manufacture of the clay globe that is the Culture Making logo would, presumably, be a bit simpler.)
