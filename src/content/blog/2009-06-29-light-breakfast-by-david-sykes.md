One of my favorite questions in the world is "What did you have for breakfast this morning?" This cheeky take on an answer looks to be a rubberized version of the not-so-light English [full breakfast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_breakfast), with eggs, sausages, tomato, and little gassy [Heinz Baked Beanz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Beanz).
