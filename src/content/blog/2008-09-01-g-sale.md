  A sign so brief speaks,  
  Words dance in burgundy hues,  
  Life and lit converge.

This is a sign one of my neighbors set out up the street earlier this summer. I was impressed by its somewhat manic brevity—and how, in the context, the first letter is really all that's needed. (At the time I also happened to be reading John Berger's novel [G.](http://web.archive.org/web/20230826061202/https://www.amazon.com/G-Novel-John-Berger/dp/0679736549), whose [cover](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22cover%22%20amazon.com) in the paperback I had was in the same burgundy-and-golden-brown range—a lovely random convergance of cultural artifacts, of life and lit)
