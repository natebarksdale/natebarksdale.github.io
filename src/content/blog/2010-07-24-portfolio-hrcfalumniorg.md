![](@assets/images/clip_hrcfalumni.jpg) I serve on the board of the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship Alumni Organization; I did a simple redesign for the [HRCFAlumni.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20170610041943/http://hrcfalumni.org/) website, which facilitates alumni support of several campus fellowships at Harvard. (See also the [annual letter](https://www.natebarksdale.com/n/276) I designed for the group.) Design-wise, this was my first experiment with TypeKit web font implementation
