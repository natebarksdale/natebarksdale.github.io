I helped fact-check this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2YD5pP7X1S7uUurlYgDGNc?si=tgz-2VqgRtmm5RLo7-oQTA) for The History Channel.

> May 23, 1701. Captain William Kidd is hanged at Execution Dock in London. His death sentence cements his legacy as one of history’s most notorious pirates, but he went to the gallows claiming to be an innocent man. And he may have been telling the truth. Nonetheless, his execution began a worldwide ripple effect that would change the high seas forever and ultimately help prosecute one of the most infamous Nazis that ever lived.
