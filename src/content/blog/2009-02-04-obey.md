![image](http://culture-making.com/media/470_20906.jpg)Though he's now more known for his earnest interpretations of old-school political posters, designer [Shepard Fairey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_Fairey) first, of course, gained noteriety with his ironic/absurdist interpretations of authoritarian propaganda, with his [Obey Giant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_the_Giant_Has_a_Posse) viral campaign. Ironic and cool, in a particularly American sense that I both find attractive and uncomfortable, kind of the way I feel about ironic t-shirts after travelling in Africa and seeing them everywhere, courtesy bales of donated and resold used American clothing (shirt on a kid begging from me at the bus depot in Vilankulos, Mozambique: "There's only one thing to make for dinner: Reservations!"). The more I learn, the more I wonder about the effort we put into being connoisseurs of manufactured irony. There's real stuff out there that's so much more amazing
