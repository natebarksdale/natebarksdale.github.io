  Words of love and pain,  
  Ink flows like the gazelles run,  
  Beauty in heart's ache.

This beautiful gazelle contains lines from the great eighteenth-century Urdu poet [Mir Taqi Mir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_Taqi_Mir), one of the great masters of the [ghazal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazal) poetic form. (The gazelle-ghazal Arabic pun does not pass unnoticed. Wish I could figure out what the text itself is about—beyond the ghazal-standard "poetic expression of both the pain of loss or separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain").
