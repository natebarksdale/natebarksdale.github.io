  Garbage veils the past,  
  Misty mountains rise anew,  
  Art's breath on the ghosts.

Another of Yao Lu's photos just won the BMW–Paris Photo prize, which is how I heard about him: "The artist photographs mounds of garbage covered in green protective nets which he assembles and reworks by computer to create bucolic images of mountain landscapes shrouded in the mist inspired by traditional Chinese paintings. Lying somewhere between painting and photography, between the past and the present, Yao Lu’s work speaks of the radical mutations affecting nature in China as is it subjected to rampant urbanization and the ecological threats that endanger the environment
