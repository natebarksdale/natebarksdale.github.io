  Stripes on the street,  
  Zebras dance through city lights,  
  Cars stop, laughter peaks.

A fun quick way to address (or at least bring attention to) a public safety concern. It does seem like the zebra costumes' restricted vision might be a problem. Also ironic given that real-life zebras' stripes function as camouflage .

> [A video clip of La Paz, Bolivia’s crossing guard zebras](http://www.lonelyplanet.tv/Clip.aspx?key=F6C841FC760DECE9), the Cebra Voluntaria. Traffic in La Paz is so dangerous that its mayor started a program to have youths dressed as zebras help people across the city’s busiest intersections. From [the recent issue of Monocle](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22the%20recent%20issue%20of%20Monocle%22%20monocle.com):

> > It doesn’t get much busier than La Paz’s Plaza San Francisco of a Friday afternoon. Two zebras stand on the curb chatting with a teenage girl. Then something remarkable happens: the traffic light turns red, and at the sight of the zebras, the cars actually stop. One driver, however, is a little slow and the nose of his car is left hanging over the crossing. One of the zebras skips over to the offending car and mimes pushing it backwards. Then he continues skipping across to the other side of the street
