[![](https://www.natebarksdale.com/wp-content/uploads/portfolio/birdsongs_3d.jpg)](https://www.natebarksdale.com/wp-content/uploads/portfolio/birdsongs_3d.jpg) Some friends of mine commissioned a 60th birthday gift for their father, an avid birdwatcher. The three-disc set featured 60 songs about 60 bird species. Tracks 1-30 ("Birdsongs") each represented a different avian order, from hummingbirds to ostriches. Tracks 31-60 ("Songbirds") featured tracks for 30 families from the order _Passeriformes_. The design was based on a typical birdwatchers' field guide; each song included textual commentary noting year of recording, language, and relevant quotes; a photograph from Wikepidia and a custom inset map showing the range of the song's actual (or, in a few cases, homonymous) subject.
