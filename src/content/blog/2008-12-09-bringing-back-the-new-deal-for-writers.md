The output of the 1930s Federal Writers Project, especially some of the oral histories, looks [pretty interesting](http://books.google.com/books?lr=&ei=1t4-SbSrLIX6kgTC5fjWBw&q=inauthor:%22+Federal+Writers%27+Project%22&as_brr=0&sa=N&start=40). a [NYTimes.com ideas blog](http://ideas.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/am-edition-a-new-deal-program-for-writers/) post, 9 December 2008

> **Journalism |** While we‚Äôre on the subject of a New New Deal, an unemployed newsman [says](http://web.archive.org/web/20090216165031/http://www.tnr.com:80/politics/story.html?id=428819dc-f4bf-4db3-a6e8-1b601c8fe273), how about resurrecting F.D.R.‚Äôs Federal Writers Project to tide over all the laid-off journalists displaced by the turmoil in their industry? They could chronicle ‚Äúthe ground-level impact of the Great Recession‚Äù or the transition to a green economy. And who knows? There might be a Steinbeck, Terkel or Ellison among them too.
