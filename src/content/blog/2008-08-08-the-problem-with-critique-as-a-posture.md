title: The problem with critique as a posture
slug: the-problem-with-critique-as-a-posture

description: An insightful critique on the challenges of cultural engagement and the tendency toward passive critique rather than active enjoyment of cultural goods. "When critique becomes a posture, we end up strangely passive, waiting for culture to deliver us some new item to talk about. Critique as a posture, while an improvement over condemnation as a posture, can leave us strangely unable simply to enjoy cultural goods, preoccupied with our interrogation of their 'worldview' and 'presuppositions.'"

  Critique whispers loud,  
  Missing joy in moments,  
  Art to simply love.

When critique becomes a posture, we end up strangely passive, waiting for culture to deliver us some new item to talk about. Critique as a posture, while an improvement over condemnation as a posture, can leave us strangely unable simply to enjoy cultural goods, preoccupied with our interrogation of their “worldview” and “presuppositions.”
