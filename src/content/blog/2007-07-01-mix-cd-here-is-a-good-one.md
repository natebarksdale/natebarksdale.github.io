#### Wimbo Zuri Catalog No. 035.1A07-1

A mix of equal parts hip-hop, indy pop, and sound clips from strange old movies I've seen on TCM. The cover illustration comes from a vintage advertising card for a [200lb. roll-top oak desk](http://web.archive.org/web/20051121024938/http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu:80/eaa/ephemera/A03/A0348/A0348-01-72dpi.html).
