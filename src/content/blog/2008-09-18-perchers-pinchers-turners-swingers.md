  Bread's dance through heat,  
  Vintage whirs and clever twists,  
  Toasted memories rise.

A glorious celebration of the toaster in its various vintage forms. The [photo galleries](http://www.toastermuseum.com/scripts/toastercollection/col_character01.html) in particular are worth getting lost in, come breakfast-time

> For inventors and engineers of toasters it seemed to be a big challenge to create as many as possible different technical solutions to ... well ... heat and rotate a simple square slice of bread
>
> - **Perchers** The bread stands alone
> - **Pinchers** The bread is pinched at its place
> - **Turners** The bread is turned horizontally
> - **Swingers** The bread is turned vertically
> - **Sliders** The bread slides in the toaster
> - **Drive Thrus** The bread drives thru the toaster
> - **Tippers** The bread tips out the toaster
> - **Floppers** (Turn Overs) The bread flops out and flips over
> - **Droppers** The bread falls through a trap door
