  Maps of old erased,  
  History fades from our sight,  
  Richness lost in bytes.

I think the Cartographic Society's argument only carries so far‚Äîfirst, because any map-making is by its nature an act of editing, simplification, stylization, and erasure; and second, because as the technology improves, we'll start to see more ways of accessing the info included on the old maps as well as the new. a [NYTimes.com Ideas Blog](http://ideas.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/the-trouble-with-online-maps/) post, 12 September 2008

> The president of the British Cartographic Society says Internet mapping (Google Maps etc.) is wiping away the richness of Britain‚Äôs geography and history. She says ‚Äúcorporate cartographers‚Äù are leaving off landmarks like churches, ancient woodlands and stately homes. And history out of sight is history out of memory.
