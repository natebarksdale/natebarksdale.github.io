  From lush hedge to sky,  
  Gardeners tend to beauty,  
  Canyon whispers green.

From the flickr caption: "The Castle of Gourdon is close by [Saint Paul de Vence, Provence](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=43.697222,7.123056&spn=0.1,0.1&t=h&q=43.697222,7.123056), on the top of a mountain. Its gardens were designed by Le Notre, Louix XIV's gardener who also did Versailles park." I love the perspectiveâ€”looking down from the cultivated area into the wilderness of the canyonâ€”and how it shows the gardeners hard at work on the hedges (and careful enough to use a drop-cloth for the clippings). Cultivation indeed. [![photo](http://culture-making.com/media/4920772_b2c71f378f_b.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/feuilllu/4920772/)
