Last night I wisely skipped the presidential debate to watch Raj Kapoor's 1955 Bollywood classic _Shri 420_ , whose opening song, "Mera Juta Hai Japani," has been running through my head off and on for a good decade. The song, like the film, is a fable of modernity, urbanization and globalization: what do we make of a world where everything around us comes from somewhere else? What's lost, what's gained, and what can we hold onto?
