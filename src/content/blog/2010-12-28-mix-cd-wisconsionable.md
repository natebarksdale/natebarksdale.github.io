#### Wimbo Zuri Catalog No. 055.1A10-1

From the [**50 States!**](https://www.natebarksdale.com/?tag=states) series of CDs, commissioned for three friends with Wisconsin connections. Challenges for this mix included keeping the dairy references to a minimum, and figuring out how to make Liberace, arguably the most important pop artist to come out of the state, play nice with everyone else.
