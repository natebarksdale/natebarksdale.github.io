#### Wimbo Zuri Catalog No. 037.1A07-1

I put together this mix after reading Helio Ovorio's excellent guidebook _[Cuban Music from A to Z](http://books.google.com/books?id=XGzKzOH9vawC&printsec=frontcover&dq=cuban+music+from+a+to+z&hl=en&ei=I1lsTeOlCY24sQOhgMWqBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false)_. It's by no means as encyclopedic, but it does thread together compositions from more than a century's worth of _rumba_ and _son_.
