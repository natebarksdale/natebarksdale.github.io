This well-done interactive site allows users to contribute frames to a rotoscoped music video of Johnny Cash's "last recording," a cover of the gospel standard "Ain't No Grave." Contributors can select or be assigned a frame from the source video (a moody compendium of archival footage) and then trace and rework it using drawing tools provided by the website. Since people are always contributing new frame drawings, the video changes quite a bit if you rewatch it a few days later. Needless to say, this is no mere cobbled-together fan site‚Äîthe [credits page alone](http://www.thejohnnycashproject.com/#/credits) is impressive
