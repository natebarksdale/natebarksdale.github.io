  Orange roots take shape,  
  Breeders weave their legacy,  
  Color, power, and taste.

It's fun to be reminded how many of our 'natural' foods are in fact the result of a long collaboration between cultivator and cultivated, guided by the possibilities and limits of agriculture and by the choices and preferances of particular people in particular settings. According to the [World Carrot Museum](http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/)—let me say that again: the [World Carrot Museum](http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/)—the long orange carrot of supermarket and snowman-nose and Bugs Bunney fame was popularized by Dutch breeders in the 17th century, perhaps as a tribute to [William of Orange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Silent), the the Dutch independance leader who became a Calvinist and helped get the 80 years war started. His grandson [William III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England) ruled the Netherlands and, later on, the British Isles, where he was responsible for the introduction of orange as the favored color of Irish protestants.
