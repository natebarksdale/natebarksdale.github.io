> _Wherever you go in the world, the food of the street represents the identity of the people. Clues to culture, race, and religion can be found in the local cuisine._

> That quote kicks off the [Penang-focused show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odhNzKctM6w) of an [Al Jazeera series on street food around the world](http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=AlJazeeraEnglish&search_query=street food) (heads up courtesy of [noodlepie](http://web.archive.org/web/20231210130316/https://noodlepie.typepad.com/)). And I couldn’t have said it better myself.

> Simply put, you haven’t experienced Penang, not the _real_ Penang, until you’ve eaten on its streets. And the same, I would argue, could be said for any other place in the world that street food still exists

> Street food naysayers miss the point. When it comes to eating on the street it’s not _only_ about the food. (And it’s not about proving your traveling cohones either.) Be open to the whole experience, and a street food meal will give as much insight into a place and a culture as any guidebook intro. Plus, you get to fill your belly at the same time.
