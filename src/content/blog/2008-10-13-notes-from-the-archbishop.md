> **Literature |** A [reviewer](http://web.archive.org/web/20091005192457/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article4905068.ece) says it’s a good thing the [archbishop of Canterbury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Williams) has written a [book](http://web.archive.org/web/20231120170635/https://www.amazon.com/Dostoevsky-Language-Fiction-Christian-Imagination/dp/1602581452) about Dostoyevsky. To figure out this Russian fellow, “we need a guide who combines the gifts of a literary critic and a trained theologian.” And like Dostoyevsky, the cleric, through his unruly Church of England, knows what it’s like to juggle “incompatible beliefs.” [[TLS](http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article4905068.ece)]
