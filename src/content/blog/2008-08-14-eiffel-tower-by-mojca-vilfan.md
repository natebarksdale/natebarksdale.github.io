  Upside-down view sings,  
  Patterns trace the earth below,  
  Stories intertwine.

I like how this is an upside-down perspective, but also from above. And -- totally tangentially -- the patterns in the sand remind me of: the story of Jesus and the Woman Caught in Adultery; the propensity of elephants (at least bored zoo elephants) to pick up sticks with their trunks and doodle in the dust; and, bringing it back home, Andy's elegant description of the ever-widening circle of bare earth made by his kids' dragging feet beneath the swing in his yard
