[![](@assets/images/birdsongs_3d.jpg)](@assets/images/birdsongs_3d.jpg) Since 2005 I have been curating and designing custom mix CDs under the Wimbo Zuri imprint. Wimbo Zuri—which means "Beautiful Song" in Swahili—offers music lovers who want to commission a special, personalized gift for their significant others, family members, or friends. A typical Wimbo Zuri mix includes songs selected for their musical, lyrical, cultural, and historic quality. A typical mix features songs spanning several decades, in several languages, joined together by a common theme.

- **Locally-flavored road-trip mixes:** Pick a state, country, region, or route
- **Literature-based mixes:** Eclectic riffing off of themes and charactars from books of the bible or your favorite big novel
- **Mixes for friend groups:** Perfect for reunions!
- **Acrostic mixes (perfect for birthdays)** Awesome, carefully selected playlists with secret messages encoded in the first letters of each song
- **Mixes for Weddings and Other Celebrations**
- **Science-Based Mixes** We specialize in taxonomy (songs for different kinds of animals and plants—insects, birds, trees). Want a mix of songs about stars, in order of brightness? We've got you covered. Anything else you can imagine? Just ask

The pricing: Once WZ covers its pass-through costs (mp3s, materials, postage), the album will already be quite a bit more expensive (~$30) than something you would have bought on iTunes (~$15). But we think it's worth it.
- Existing album: **$30**
- Simple design tweak to existing album: **$20**
- Thorough personalization of existing album: **$70**
- Totally new, soup-to-nuts personalized album: **$150**
