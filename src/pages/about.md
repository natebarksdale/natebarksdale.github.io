I'm currently looking for new clients and partners for one-off or long-term projects spanning writing, editing, fact-checking, and exploring AI tools and use cases. If you think I might be a good match for your team or project, get in touch at [info@natebarksdale.xyz](mailto:info@natebarksdale.xyz)

Hi, I'm Nate. I have a decade-plus experience serving clients in the overlapping realms of writing, editing and graphic design. I love working with clients to find the best expression of their vision, and to deliver results that are both excellent and humane.

- Interdisciplinary writer, editor, and fact-checker, skilled at getting your prose or mine to be informative, concise, factual, and on tone.
- Design problem-solver skilled at making information elegant, organized and accessible.
- Researching and experimenting with AI tools to understand what they're good for, where they miss the mark, and how those answers are in flux.
- See more on my [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nate-barksdale-57674a31/)

Key clients have included major media companies, technology and finance startups, and philanthropic foundations. I have an A.B. from Harvard in the [History of Science](https://histsci.fas.harvard.edu/) (with coursework in physics, computer science and design), and have long been interested in making connections between different disciplines — bridging visuals and text, art and commerce, reason and wonder.

# History.com

I helped oversee the editorial scope of the History Channel’s [Webby-winning](https://winners.webbyawards.com/2015/apps-dapps-and-software/handheld-devices/travel-handheld-devices/159568/history-here) app telling US history through pins on a map (and personally writing up thousands of fascinating sites along the way).I helped develop and maintain the master list of potential sites to feature, and created a ranking algorithm to help the team figure out which places to tackle first.I also work with [History.com](https://www.history.com/) on various fact-checking and editorial projects ranging from podcasts to social media to the book [_This Day in History for Kids_](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/94885-hearst-home-kids-releases-the-history-channel-s-debut-children-s-book.html) and the newly updated [White House tour signage](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/21/first-lady-jill-biden-unveils-enhanced-and-expanded-white-house-tour/).

# Templeton

I've profiled people and projects investigating the universe's biggest mysteries for [The John Templeton Foundation's website](https://www.templeton.org/about-our-authors).I've loved the challenge of diving deep with experts on topics ranging from Big Bang cosmology to human evolution to philosophy and theology, and finding ways to explain just how fascinating it is for the general reader.

# Eventide

Since 2012 I've worked on various projects with [Eventide Asset Management](https://www.eventideinvestments.com/) as an external partner focused on Graphic and Web Design, helping with their mission to offer "Investing that makes the world rejoice®"

# Envoy & Homefront

I worked on design and prototyping for [Envoy](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/envoy-4) and [Homefront](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/homefront-c3b1), two San Francisco-based seed stage startups investigating the potential for technologies to change the way we eat, live, and care for our loved ones.

# Other Clients & Projects

Over the past few years I've helped smaller design and editorial projects for clients including tech and policy startups, nonprofits, thinktanks, a high-end art dealer and a global beverage conglomerate.

From 2008 to 2012, I worked with my longtime mentor and collaborator Andy Crouch on Culture-Making.com, a link blog he launched in conjunction with his book. I was the lead writer for the site, posting links and commentary several times a week about the true, the beautiful, the interesting relating to human cultural output. The old site is on ice, but I've resurrected the bulk of my posts on this site.

During the golden age of budget travel guides, I spent two years editing an [800-page guidebook to India and Nepa](https://archive.org/details/letsgoindianepal0000bark)l. — I spent a similar span editing (along with Andy Crouch) the award-winning magazine _re:generation quarterly_. I've also written for _[Comment](https://comment.org/contributors/nate-barksdale/)_, _[Books & Culture](https://www.booksandculture.com/articles/2013/sepoct/cell-phone-gospel.html)_, Ozy, and — ages ago — the _[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-02-27-vw-4397-story.html)_. I was once interviewed on [Irish public radio](https://www.rte.ie/) as an expert on [drive-thru restaurants](https://www.history.com/news/drive-thru-dining-history-in-n-out-burger).
