## Elegant Problem-Solving

- Interdisciplinary writer, editor, and fact-checker, skilled at getting your prose or mine to be informative, concise, factual, and on tone.
- Design problem-solver skilled at making information elegant, organized and accessible.
- Researching and experimenting with Artifical Intelligence tools to understand what they're good for, where they miss the mark, and how those answers are in flux.

I have an A.B. from Harvard in the [History of Science](https://histsci.fas.harvard.edu/) (with coursework in physics, computer science and design), and have long been interested in making connections between different disciplines — bridging visuals and text, art and commerce, reason and wonder.I love working with clients to find the best expression of their vision, and to deliver results that are both excellent and humane.

## The History Channel

_Writing, research, editing, fact-checking, editorial consulting, project management_

I helped oversee the editorial scope of the History Channel’s [Webby-winning](https://winners.webbyawards.com/2015/apps-dapps-and-software/handheld-devices/travel-handheld-devices/159568/history-here) app telling US history through pins on a map (and personally writing up thousands of fascinating sites along the way).I helped develop and maintain the master list of potential sites to feature, and created a ranking algorithm to help the team figure out which places to tackle first.I also work with [History.com](https://www.history.com/) on various fact-checking and editorial projects ranging from podcasts to social media to the book [_This Day in History for Kids_](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/94885-hearst-home-kids-releases-the-history-channel-s-debut-children-s-book.html) and the newly updated [White House tour signage](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/21/first-lady-jill-biden-unveils-enhanced-and-expanded-white-house-tour/).`writing` `fact-checking` `editing` `script review`

## Eventide Asset Management

_Graphic design for web and print, data-wrangling, document production management_

I worked with [Eventide Asset Management](https://www.eventideinvestments.com/) to design and reliably update dozens of excitingly boring quarterly and annual documents quickly, accurately, and on-brand.I created backend task management systems to adapt document design, content and compliance workflows as Eventide has grown from a startup with a few million in assets under management to an established family of mutual funds managing more than $6 billion in clients’ ethical investments.`design` `project management` `workflow` `low-code` `html/css/php` `adobe` `site maintenance`

## The John Templeton Foundation

_Science writing_

I've profiled people and projects investigating the universe's biggest mysteries for [The John Templeton Foundation's website](https://www.templeton.org/about-our-authors).I've loved the challenge of diving deep with experts on topics ranging from Big Bang cosmology to human evolution to philosophy and theology, and finding ways to explain just how fascinating it is for the general reader.`features` `interviews` `blog posts` `study of the day`

## Envoy and Homefront

_Graphic design, product design, early-stage brainstorming_

I worked on design and prototyping for [Envoy](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/envoy-4) and [Homefront](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/homefront-c3b1), two San Francisco-based seed stage startups investigating the potential for technologies to change the way we eat, live, and care for our loved ones.`figma` `InVision` `html/css` `Adobe Suite`

## Other Writing and Editing

During the golden age of budget travel guides, I spent two years editing an [800-page guidebook to India and Nepa](https://archive.org/details/letsgoindianepal0000bark)l. — I spent a similar span editing (along with Andy Crouch) the award-winning magazine _re:generation quarterly_. I've also written for _[Comment](https://comment.org/contributors/nate-barksdale/)_, _[Books & Culture](https://www.booksandculture.com/articles/2013/sepoct/cell-phone-gospel.html)_, Ozy, and — ages ago — the _[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-02-27-vw-4397-story.html)_. I was once interviewed on [Irish public radio](https://www.rte.ie/) as an expert on [drive-thru restaurants](https://www.history.com/news/drive-thru-dining-history-in-n-out-burger).
