      "Since 2012, I've worked with editors, producers and executives at History Channel and History.com on various editorial and fact-checking projects, including bylined encyclopedia articles and behind-the-scenes work on editorial and visual fact-checking for website content and the occasional TV project. My largest single project with History was the (alas, now defunct) History Here app. I began as a copywriter but was soon assigned effective oversight of content strategy and implementation for the full app, writing about thousands of historic points of interest in the U.S. and ranking and assigning thousands more for other writers on the team. The app was twice nominated for a Webby Award, and [won in 2015](https://winners.webbyawards.com/2015/apps-dapps-and-software/handheld-devices/travel-handheld-devices/159568/history-here). ",
